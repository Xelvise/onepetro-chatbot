Abstract


In this study, the hole cleaning qualities of mud samples formulated with tigernut derivatives – starch and fibre – as additives were determined by adding drill cuttings as impurities and evaluating the Carrying Capacity Index (CCI) as well as Transport Index (TI) of the muds. Results of the analysis conducted for the mud properties showed that all the different mud properties but the pH of the mud evaluated of mud samples B, C1, C2, and C3 were slightly higher (albeit within the recommended values) than those of the control (standard) mud sample A. Using the results obtained from mud properties analysis and drilling operations data for the evaluation of the hole cleaning qualities, the following new expressions for optimum cuttings lifting ability (β) and cuttings lifting coefficient (β1), which gives criteria for cutting lifting in a wellbore were developed: β1 = 0.11519 [(1 − Cf)]−1(dp)−2.014. The higher the value of β1 greater than one, the better the hole cleaning ability of the mud and the lower the mud flowrate needed to achieve better hole cleaning for a given cutting particle size.

Introduction


The key to a successful hole cleaning relies upon integrating optimum drilling fluid properties with best drilling practices. Good solids control begins with good hole cleaning and there are several factors that affect it. One of the primary functions of the drilling fluid is to bring drilled cuttings to the surface in a state that enables the drilling-fluid processing equipment to remove them with ease (Amoco, 2016; Baroid, 1998). To achieve this end, quick and efficient removal of cuttings is essential. In aqueous-based fluids, when drilled solids become too small to be removed by the solids-control equipment, they are re-circulated down-hole and dispersed further by a combination of high-pressure shear from the mud pumps, passing through the bit, and the additional exposure to the drilling fluid. The particles become so small that they must be removed via the centrifuge overflow (which discards mud too) and/or a combination of dilution and chemical treatment. Thus, to minimize mud losses, drilled solids must be removed as early as possible (ASME, 2005).


In rotary drilling operations, both the fluid and the rock fragments are moving in the annulus. The situation is complicated by the fact that the fluid velocity varies from zero at the wall to a maximum at a point between the pipe outer wall and the wellbore wall. In addition, the rotation of the drill-pipe impacts centrifugal force on the rock fragments, which affects their relative location in the annulus. As a result of the extreme complexity of this flow behavior, drilling personnel have relied primarily on observation and experience for determining the lifting ability of the drilling fluids. In practice, either the flow rate or effective viscosity of the fluid is increased, if problems related to inefficient cuttings removal are encountered. The result is a natural tendency towards thick muds and high annular velocities (Abdul et al., 2002).


However, increasing the mud viscosity or flow rate can be detrimental to the cleaning action beneath the bit, and cause a reduction in the penetration rate. Also there is a considerable economic penalty associated with the use of a higher flow rate or mud viscosity than necessary. Increasing the mud viscosity will not necessarily improve the cuttings transport efficiency in directional and horizontal sections as well. Transport is usually not a problem, if the well is near vertical. However, considerable difficulties can occur when the well is being drilled directionally, because cuttings may accumulate either as a stationary bed at hole angles above about 50° or in a moving, churning bed at lower hole angles. Drilling problems that may result are various and the severities are high (Petrowiki, 2018).


One of the criteria for assessing the performance of drilling fluid is its hole cleaning ability, especially in the transportation of drill cuttings from down hole to the surface. This criterion is even much more difficult for highly deviated wells. The ease with which this can be done depends on certain properties the mud must possess. There are several critical elements that affect cutting lifting such as hole angle of the interval, the rheology of the drilling fluid to be used for the drilling operation, the cuttings size, shape, density, integrity, and sphericity, the rate of penetration, the drill string rotational rate, the drill string eccentricity for laminar flow and turbulent flow, the drilling fluid density, the flow rate or annular velocity (Ali et al., 2012; Unegbu, 2010; and AMSE, 2005).


Generally, in near vertical and moderately inclined hole intervals, annular velocity (AV) has the largest impact upon whether a hole can be cleaned of cuttings (Gavignet and Sobey, 1989). The problem of cuttings transport in vertical wells has been studied for many years, with the earliest analysis of the problem being that of Pigott (1941).


Since the early 1980s, cuttings transport studies have focused on inclined wellbores using different mechanisms, which dominate within different ranges of wellbore taking angleinto consideration (Petrowiki, 2018);


Cuttings bed heights and annular cuttings concentrations as functions of operating parameters (flow rate and penetration rate)Wellbore configuration (depth, hole angle, hole size or casing/wellbore inside diameter (ID), and pipe size)Fluid properties (density and rheological properties)Cuttings characteristics (density, size, shape, bed porosity, and angle of repose)Pipe eccentricity and rotary speed.


Laboratory experience indicates that the flow rate, if high enough, will remove the cuttings for any fluid, hole size, and hole angle. Unfortunately, flow rates high enough to transport cuttings up and out of the annulus effectively cannot be used in many wells, because of limited pump capacity and/or high surface or down-hole dynamic pressures. This is particularly true for high angles with hole sizes larger than 12¼ in.


Some models for cutting transport employed either experimental, mechanistic, and or field application processes (Ford et al, 1990; Guild et al, 1995; Uduak & Pal, 2012) which includes Carrying Capacity Index (CCI=k×Av×ρm400000)⁠, Transport Ratio (TR=VfVAorTR=(99.50.01778Pr)Dhole2Qm(26.149+742.7Pr))⁠, Transport Index (TI=QdρRf834.5)⁠, Rheological Factor (RF=6K3585Aa[TICCI])⁠, and Angle Factor (Af=1AfQvertical=Qdeviated) (ASME, 2005; Robinson, 2000; Belavadi, 1994; Unegbu, 2010; and Lou et al, 1992 & 1994) but in literature there are no direct readily available expressions that easily correlates the optimum cuttings lifting criterion, which relates the ratio of mud annular velocity to cuttings slip velocity and cuttings fraction, without having to go through the cumbersome and rigorous calculations and chats and starting from first principle, etc.


Averting of this bottleneck is highly needed as it will considerably facilitate the ease of rating drilling muds in terms of their hole cleaning performance even before going into the drilling operations. This research is aimed at developing a model equation for calculating mud carrying ability and other hole cleaning parameters that will reduce the cumbersomeness and rigors in the applications of the existing methods of calculations of drilling cuttings transport to the surface in both vertical, deviated and highly deviated (horizontal) wells.

Methods


This study employed a mixed research method of Quantitative research approach which employed secondary data collection method; and Analytical research approach which employed Numerical research method for the formulation and validation of the model equation for cuttings lifting coefficient and cutting lifting criterium.


Quantitative Approach / Analysis


The secondary data used in this study are presented in  Appendix A, Table 1 and 2 below.


Numerical Approach


Formulation of Model Equations for Cuttings Transport


There are several forces acting on the particles in a flowing mud system. These forces include both natural forces (such as gravitational forces, etc.) and artificial forces (forces from the object or phase of flow). Other forces are forces based on direction of flow such as drag coefficient versus the particle Reynolds number, the particle settling in fluid, lift forces, etc (Ezekiel, 2012).


Mixture Velocity


A mixture of mud and drill cuttings flowing through a wellbore annulus, has a velocity given (Petrowiki, 2018) as:


Vmix=Qc+QmA(1)


Where Qm is the volumetric flow rate of the mud and Qc is the volumetric flow rate of the cuttings which depends on the bit size and the penetration rate. In addition, the mixture velocity can be calculated from the average plug and annulus velocities in terms of the equivalent pipe.


Cutting Concentration


The cutting concentration is defined (Petrowiki, 2018) as;


Cf=QcQc+Qm(2)


The average concentration, c, of cuttings accounts for the cuttings concentrations in the plug and annular regions. The cuttings concentrations in the plug and annular regions are assumed equal if the suspended cuttings are uniformly distributed across the area open to flow. Obviously, this assumption has a major impact, and the actual distribution is probably a function of wellbore geometry, mud properties, cuttings properties, and operating conditions. Thus, we obtain;


Vmix=CVs(1−c)c−co(3)


Where; Vs represents the average settling velocity in the axial direction.


The value calculated using equation (3) is the minimum acceptable mixture velocity required for a cuttings concentration. Pigott (1941), recommended that the concentration of suspended cuttings be a value less than 5%. With this limit (c = 0.05), equation (3) becomes;


Vmix=0.0475vs0.05−Co(4)


Where; Co< 0.05. This implies that the penetration rate must be limited to a rate that satisfies this equality. For near-vertical cases, the critical mud-cuttings mixture velocity equals the value of Equation (4). If the circulation rate exceeds this value, the suspended cuttings concentration will remain less than 5%. However, if the mud circulation velocity is less than the cuttings’ settling velocity, the cuttings will eventually build up in the wellbore and plug it.


From equation (2), Qc can be expressed in terms of Qm and cutting concentration, Cf, to give:


Qc=(Cf1−Cf)Qm(5)


Cutting Transport Criterion


Cutting annular velocity, Vc is defined (Majeed et al, 2014) as


Vc=Qc/Acf≈(Cf1−Cf)QmAcf(6)


For cutting lifting, Vc must be greater than the cutting setting velocityVs, with a positive net upward velocity equal to (Vc - Vs).


Therefore, condition for cutting lifting is that the ratio of the net upward velocity to slip velocity should be positive, i.e.


Vc−VsVs≥0orVcVs−1≥0(7)


βOrβ≥1(8)


where ββ=VcVs is the velocity ratio of the cutting annular velocity to its slip velocity, which must be greater than 1 for cutting transport to be possible. β represents the condition for cutting lifting. Hence combining equations (6 and 8), we have


β(11−Cf)×[QmAa×1Vs]=β(9)


The value [QmA×1Vs]⁠, represents the ratio of the mud annular velocity to cutting slip velocity.


Hence for cuttings lifting, we require;


𝛃β≥Qm/Aa[(1−cf)Vs]−1(10)


Where β is much greater than 1.The higher the β value, the better the particles lifting.


For laminar flow conditions


The cutting setting velocity Vs is given as [Petrowiki, 2018]:


Vs=ds2g(ρs−ρf)18μ(11)


For turbulent flow


Equations (9) to (10) will be applicable here using the appropriate expression for particle slip velocity as (Petrowiki, 2018):


Vsl=233gds(ρs−ρf)fρf(12)


Where f = 24/Rep, is the frictional factor, which is a friction of the particle Reynolds number, and shape of the particle given by sphericity.


Unfortunately, the volume of fluid required to reach critical velocity for turbulent flow is frequently outside the achievable flow rate for hole sizes larger than 8inch and is frequently limited by maximum allowable ECD and/or hole erosion concerns (Petrowiki, 2018), hence equation in this study will be confined to those for laminar flow conditions.


The numerical value for β in equation (10) can be obtained solving equation below;


β={QmAa}(11−Cf)X18μds2g(ρs−ρf)(13)


Where;


ρs = Density of solids (cuttings)


ρf = Density of the Drilling Fluid without Drill Cuttings.


If ρm is the density of the mud medium containing drill cuttings and is given as;


ρm=Cfρs+(1−Cf)ρf(14a)


When there are no drill cuttings, Cf = 0, ρm = ρf and for all cuttings only, Cf = 1, ρm = ρs.


Thus for a mud of known rheological properties, by fixing Qm – mud flow rate for given annular hole area (Aa), we obtain β-value knowing the particle size and cutting fraction in the equation (11) for laminar flow for a vertical hole. In case of deviated well, we substitute Qm = AfQdev, where Af = angle factor.


The optimum value of β can be computed for a given formulated mud at various annular flow velocities for both vertical and deviated wells using equation (13)


Cutting Lifting Coefficient and Cutting Lifting Criteria


A generalized expression for cutting lifting criterion can be developed for cuttings of different particle sizes, dp, which relates β to cutting concentrations, Cf, and the rheological properties of the mud in the form of a polynomial equation;


𝛃𝛃𝛗β'=β/QmAa=φ[(1-Cf)]y(dp)z(14b)


The numerical values of the constants, φ, y and z are evaluated graphically from various plots of β’ against Cf and dp. Positive values of β represent cutting lifting. β’ represents cutting lifting velocity ratio per unit annular flow velocity of the mud, which otherwise could be termed cutting lifting coefficient.


When the cutting lifting coefficient is multiplied by the annular mud velocity, we can obtain the mud’s ability to lift cuttings. Experimental data were used for plot of β vs cuttings size (figure 1 below) at different mud flowrates.

For Hole diameter DHole = 6.3inches and DPipe = 4inches


Evaluating β1 using Tables 1 and 2 in  Appendix A, for a given particle size for a drilling mud of known density and viscosity at different cutting concentrations, gave a power expression of the form;


β1=φ(1−Cf)yidsiz(15)


Where φi is a constant at cutting fraction, Cfi for cutting particle size, dsi.


Relating the values of φi for different cutting fractions, Cf, will yield an expression in form of equations (15) for different particle sizes give;


β1=φ(1−Cf)y(ds)z(16)


Equation (16) gives the generalized expression for cuttings lifting coefficient. Equation (16) was validated using experimental data for nine (9) mud samples with different cutting sizes and cutting fractions. The absolute deviation error, % of the experimental to the model were also obtained.


Results and Discussion


Boundary Cuttings Lifting Criteria (β) and Lifting Coefficient, (β1)


The boundary cutting lifting condition, β, and lifting coefficient (β1), which is β per unit mud annular velocity, expressed as a function of cutting size and fraction are illustrated in Tables 1 in  Appendix A. The lifting coefficient, (β1), represents the Lifting Condition per Unit Annular Velocity (equation 16) while the condition for cuttings lifting, or lifting criteria is;


β=φQmAa(1−Cf)y(ds)z(17)


Calculations for cutting diameters of 0.5mm - 5mm with of cutting fraction, Cf, in the range of 0.005 - 0.050 gave expressions in terms of Cf which when normalized for particle sizes in figure 1 below, yielded the numerical values for the constants in equation (14a) as: φ = 0.11519; y = -1 and z = -2.014 for ds = dp (0.5mm – 5mm), thus giving equation (18) below as the lifting coefficient;


β1=0.11519(1−Cf)−1(ds)−2.014(18)


and


Condition for cutting lifting, β=QmAa(β1)


β1=0.11519QmAa(1−Cf)−1(ds)−(−2.014)(19)


Where;


β1 = Optimum Lifting Coefficient, β = Cutting Lifting Criteria, φ = Constant, Cf = Cutting Fraction y = -1, ds = Particle size (0.5mm – 5mm), z = -2.014, Qm = Mud Flowrate, Aa = Annular Area


If the lifting coefficient is multiplied by the mud annular velocity (QmAa)⁠, then cutting lifting ability of a particular type of mud at different annular velocities can be easily calculated.


Equation (18) represents the boundary condition for cutting lifting. Equation (19) shows that the ability of drilling mud to lift cuttings is directly proportional to the mud flow rate and inversely proportional to the square of the cutting particles size.


Validation of Model Equation (18)


The generalized model equation for cutting lifting coefficient β’=0.11519(1 − Cf)−1(ds)−2.014 was tested using experimental data from nine mud samples with particle sizes of 150µm, 3.35mm and 5.0mm at cutting fraction of 0.005 and prediction error evaluated as shown below (Table 3).

The result shows that the equation predicted cutting lifting coefficients of the various mud samples with absolute errors between 1.3% to 3.8% while the remaining samples had error values of 9 – 12%. This shows that the model is particularly suitable for estimating cutting lifting for smaller sized cuttings.


Calculations of cutting lifting ability at mud flow rates between 140gpm and 2100gpm, illustrated in Figure 2, using Table 2 and 4 in  Appendix A, showed that good cuttings carrying was obtained for particles sizes less than 1mm at mud flow rates above 500gpm.
