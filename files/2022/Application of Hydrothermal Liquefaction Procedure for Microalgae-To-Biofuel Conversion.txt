Abstract


The thermal depolymerization process is also known as Hydrothermal liquefaction(HTL) Is used in converting macro/micro molecules, under temperatures of about 280°C and 370°C and pressures that are in the range from 10 to 25 MPa and into crude such as oil. The oil is composed of high energy density and low heating values of 33.8-36.9 MJ/Kg and 5-20 wt% renewables and oxygen. Presently microalgae are used industrially in producing high-quality products for food additives. Also, the microalgae are environmentally friendly, as it is used in the treatment of wastewater, control in the mitigation of industrial CO2 emission and atmospheric CO2 capturing. Due to environmental issues, microalgal are converted from biomass to biofuel. Recently HTL has drawn more attention, as it can be used in the refinery industry. This paper is also concerned with solving environmental issues using microalgae as an effective method for biomass to biofuel conversion. One significant advantage of HTL is the possibility of using fresh microalgae after harvesting, the processing of biomass and increased thermodynamic efficiency. The latter is achieved due to high HTL temperature and pressure which creates an avenue for more heat recovery.

Introduction


Presently, the world has been so dependent on fossil fuels, Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the leading causes of global warming of the potential (GWP) of greenhouse gases (GHG) (Lenton 2014). The rate of concentration of atmospheric CO2 has stroked 400ppm observed at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii in May 2013 (www. CO2.earth), a height never attained before, in the history of human existence. Currently, the mean annual rate of increase has increased more than twice in the 1960s (0.9), and it is 2.29 ppm in the last decade (2007-2016), and it is still increasing. Efficient and Effective preventive strategies are needed to help in the reduction of excess concentration of CO2 (Bilanovic et al. 2009).


Technologies specifically designed, for the removal of atmospheric CO2 and other particle emissions could reduce the concentration of CO2 faster than natural processes such as photosynthesis (Lemoine and Traeger 2012). For example, technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) employ photosynthetic capturing of CO2, storing the generated energy in the form of renewables such as biomass. Major terrible emissions are caused by CO2 capturing after the burning of biomass (Greene et al. 2017, Mathews 2008). According to research, it has been stated that, at a large scale, BECCS carried out on terrestrial biomass has an advanced impact on nutrients, food production, water use, land and biodiversity (Searchinger et al. 2015, Smith 2016). Controversially, according to conventional terrestrial biomass sequestration, scholars have noted the urgency of determining the potential for reduction of microalgae cultivation systems' CO2 emissions (Herzog and Drake 1996, Stewart and Hessami 2005, Wang et al. 2008).


Furthermore, microalgae have proven to have an increased growth rate with increased photosynthetic efficiency (10-20%) than most land plants (1-2%). They are much suitable for atmospheric CO2 removal, also as a source of bioenergy (Greene et al. 2016). Food security and climate can be beneficial for bioenergy production from marine microalgae (Lenton 2014, Walsh et al. 2015, Walsh et al. 2016, Greene et al. 2016). Moreover, for increased carbon fixation photosynthesis by algae in seawater, CO2 must be steadily supplied, most especially in closed cultural systems (Lenton 2014). Higher demands of CO2 for the cultivation of algae can be reached by emissions of CO2 that are typically found in typical power plants' flue gas (6-12%) (Ho et al.2011). The relevance is GHG emissions reduction from power plant stack and an effective CO2 bio-fixation route. Mediated-microalgae CO2 fixation would be highly sustained by microalgal biomass cultivation coupling with an existing power infrastructure (Kumar et al. 2010).


In our modern world today, the transportation sector accounts for 20% of global CO2 emissions (Rawat et al. 2013). Our societies have been sourcing their' energy from fossil fuels such as natural gas, petroleum crude oil and coal for both, domestic uses, transportation needs and heating duties.


More sustainable renewable fuels are needed due to their' decreased environmental concerns, reduced availability and socioeconomic implications of fossil sources. Biofuels can be found in a state of matter either, liquid, solid or gaseous state. The production of biofuels driven by biological carbon sequestration can be the best effective alternative to supplement fossil fuels (Singh, Nigam and Murphy 2011). Biofuels can be used for numerous purposes such as transportation, heat and base fuel for electricity production.


The production and the current use of biofuels as an alternative to replacing fossil fuels, signify the effort for GHG reductions. Biofuels are crucial topics in our world today and have been researched about for many decades (Hoekman 2009). Terminologies such as the "first-, second-, and third-generation" biofuels are distinguished and used to distinguish between simple, traditional biofuels and more complex, advanced ones. The "first-generation" term is used to refer, to biofuels produced from easily available, commonly edible feedstock using already established conversion technologies. Examples of first-generation biofuels include ethanol produced through the fermentation of sugars and biodiesel manufactured through the transesterification of triglycerides. The "second generation" term is used in referring to biofuels that are either produced from non-food feedstock, advanced or produced through advanced processing technology. Also, examples of advanced processing technology are catalytic hydroprocessing of triglycerides used in the production of renewable diesel and the conversion of lignocellulose (Hoekmann et al. 2012).


Algal biofuels are considered and are also known as "third-generation" biofuels. The energy gotten from the sun, which is solar energy is converted into bioenergy through the green growth stimulated by the photosynthetic production process. Algal biomass can be used or can serve as a raw material for advanced biological or thermochemical transformation processes (Tian et al. 2014b). Records have it that biofuels produced using marine microalgae can help eliminate our society's overreliance on fossil fuels (Pacala and Socolow 2004). Many conversion technologies not limited to hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), have shown significant feasibility in processing microalgae. As a wet method, HTL has the plus advantage of not demanding to dry feedstock.


MICROALGAE FOR SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT


Microalgae are considered to be among the first evolving organisms that surfaced more than 3 billion years ago in the earth's ocean, during the formation of the earth's environment. Presently, there are more than thousands of organisms existing not only in the ocean but in freshwater also such as ponds, lakes and rivers. However, there are hundreds of thousands of algae species in human existence that ranges from microscopic organisms to 60m in length. Algae are evenly and widespread in the world, there are tendencies of seeing microalgae even in the arctic snow.


MICROALGAE GROWTH ASPECTS


The growth of microalgae consists of chlorophyll which produces oxygen through carbon dioxide atmospheric capturing during photosynthesis. However, microalgae continue to contribute to the atmospheric formation of the earth by continuously absorbing the emitted carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere through industrial activities carried out by humans and the respiratory activity of animals. microalgae also serve as an oxygen producers and zooplankton and fish feed. One of the significances of the cultivation of microalgae industrially is the positive encouraging environmental advance effect with carbon capture and oxygen production. As a result of the continuously expanding of fossil fuels, the cultivation of microalgae industrially becomes more significant. Microalgae grow by a process known as photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide and Solar light are absorbed by chlorophyll and transformed into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and oxygen. The energy produced is used in the respiration, which helps in the development of algae cells (Brennan et al 2010) Photosynthetic reaction can be explained in the equation below:


6CO2+6H2O+nhv→C6H12O6+6O2(1)


where


hν is the energy of a single photon


n is the number of photons.


A part of the solar spectrum is used by photosynthesis in the form of the wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm only. Spectral radiation is known as photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). According to the measured average solar spectrum, the total solar at the earth's surface within PAR is about 48.7%(KPAR) which is of the incident solar energy (Zhu et al 2008). A greater amount of radiation from solar falls outside the PAR region and has remained unusable in photosynthesis. According to equation (1), 8-10 absorbed photons from the PAR range are required in reducing one molecule of CO2 to glucose. About eight photons contain roughly 1.6 MJ of energy. However, one calorific glucose is 470 kJ/mol of the reduced CO2. The rate of light energy conversion can be calculated this way: KPS=≈ 470 1600 03 /. where KPS is the ratio of the energy content of the resulting occurring organic substance to the total energy of every photon reacting under photosynthesis (for PAR region). Moreover, KPS is highly smaller in real-life applications. Photosynthetic organisms possess multiple intracellular mechanisms for light-harvesting, thus enabling them to maximize radiations from certain wavelengths, or in a shorter range within the PAR region (1921). Due to this factor, the adaptability/manoeuvring of incident light is crucial to improving microalgal biomass production (Seo et al 2014). The highest value of KPS is estimated to be around 13%. Thus the efficiency of sunlight conversion to microalgal biomass is estimated using KPS and KPARK=KPAR×KPS=0.487×0.13≈0.06⁠: The most significant endangering factor for the cultivation of a large quantity of microalgal is centred on the issues of the uses of light. This is highly noted in large cultivation of microalgal outdoors as there is an increase in the growth and performance of every photosynthetic organism rely not solemnly on the light absorbed but on also the composition of the spectral light. The power of absorbed light relies on many factors such as; the volume fraction of culture, the specific position of a cell, etc. The spatial distribution of the light absorbed within the system cultivated is a key factor in microalgal photo physiology and ecology. However, the growth of microalgae is not possible without solar irradiation which also leads to heating water and suspended microalgae.


Solar irradiation and heating of microalgae


The suspension of microalgae life in water is not possible without significant thermal radiation supplied by the sun. Moreover, it does not rely just on photosynthesis but on also the heating of water within its surrounding. As already stated, for photosynthesis to occur, there has to be significant sunlight in the narrow part of the visible spectral light. It is necessary to understand that the energy from solar radiation is not just for photosynthesis but also the heating of microalgae. Water is highly transparent in the visible and near-infrared spectral radiation (Hale et al 1973) and this radiation from the sun is only absorbed by microalgae. This heating/heat is also transferred to the surrounding bodies of water (near a wavelength of λ=3µm). Due to the small sizes of microalgal cells, it does not require intense/direct heating from the sun, as a result of this, there is thermal equilibrium between microalgae and the surrounding bodies of water. This, however, simplifies the field temperature calculations in the volume where the microalgae are grown. Moreover, the remedy for the transient heat transferred is demanded considering both the integral (over the spectrum) volume absorption of radiation and the heating transfer as a result of heat transfer from conduction and convection. However, we are not considering the problems associated with heat transfer.


RADIATIVE TRANSFER


Radiative transfer of microalgae in a suspended layer in several studies considering radiative transfer in a composite medium, consisting of absorbing and scattering particles, the researchers have considered the traditional approach and with the radiative transfer equation (RTE) for the intensity of the spectral radiation (Dombrovsky et al 2010, Howell et al 2010, Modest, M. F. 2013). The intensity of radiation does not solemnly rely on spatial variables but also considers two angular coordinates used in determining the direction of radiation. The resultant effect of RTE in a scattered media consists of an integral term used in describing the scattered radiation. An authentic remedy to the RTE in a scattered medium is a highly complicated task. Unfortunately, in the stated issue, it is more convenient to look into the approximate transportation of the scattered phase function and the simplified differential method rather than the complete RTE (Dombrovsky, et al 2010, Dombrovsky 2012). However, scholars should recall recent studies related to this method in solving physically related issues (Dombrovsky et al 2007, Dombrovsky et al 2011, Dombrovsky et al 2012, Dombrovsky et al 2015, Dombrovsky et al 2016, Dombrovsky et al 2017, Dombrovsky et al 2018). A similar methodology has been proposed and used in the aforementioned theoretical papers by other researchers in calculating the radiative transfer in photobioreactors. The linear relationship of RTE makes it feasible and possible to consider differentiating the collimated and diffused components of the radiation field. In so doing, the differential techniques are relatively used in diffusing the components that are predominantly case sensitive to media scattering. The resultant boundary value for spectral irradiance can readily be solution-driven in the sense of complex-shaped photobioreactors. Moreover, it is enough to state that the developed theoretical and computational techniques are sufficient to calculate the field of absorbed spectral solar radiation in photobioreactors.


FLUE GAS UTILIZATION BY MICROALGAE


The cultivation of microalgae can be used in mitigating the CO2 emitted industrially from power plants by the biotransformation of microalgal biomass. Adjusting the use of microalgae that are based on CO2 sequestration can be used as a sustainable solution for the control of CO2 (Pavlik et al 2017). Approximately, about 1.83-1.88kg of CO2 can be contained in 1kg of microalgal biomass (6667). Typically, the concentration of CO2 in flue gas is around 15 vol.% which is approximately times 400 higher when compared to the atmospheric CO2 (Lam et al 2011, McGinn et al 2011). The various forms of solubilization of mass transferred CO2 into aqueous media of microalgae culture system upon feeding of CO2 includes CO2, CO32−, HCO3− and H2CO3 (depending on the medium pH) and the uptake of microalgae during photosynthesis (Van Den Hende et al 2012). Flue gas feeding significantly leads to the acidification of the growth media, which cannot be accommodated by algae. Aside from CO2, the gas flue generated during the combustion of industrial plants usually contain inhibitory toxic pollutants Sox and NOx, which rapidly affect the growth of microalgae. However, special cultivation that prevents harmful pollutants that strongly affect the growth of microalgae should be well sorted after. Adequate utilization of flue gas can serve as a subordinate for providing a source of carbon for the production of microalgae. Challenges associated with this include the high temperature of the flue gas and the presence of harmful pollutants that prevents the direct use of industrial gas flue for the cultivation of microalgae. The utilization of gas flue has been endorsed industrially and it is presently been used in breweries, cement factories and gas-fired power plants, like the aforementioned factories, generates minimal Sox and NOx concentrations (Moreira et al 2016). Flue gas driven from coal has also been used for the cultivation of microalgae when diluted with a small added amount of air (Van Den Hende et al 2012, Kao, C.-Y. et al 2014, Moheimani, N. R. J. et al 2016). The mitigation of industrial emission of CO2 from the unfiltered stacks of the smoke of about 4 MW coal-fired power plant through biotransformation into microalgal biomass with Desmodesmus sp. Which is the dominant microalgae was demonstrated by (Aslam, A., et al. 2017).


Wastewater treatment by microalgae


Aside from the consumption of light and CO2 by microalgae, microalgae also require nutrients for their growth and survival. The cultivation of microalgae successfully depends so much on nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. In order words, to achieve an increased growth rate, inorganic fertilizers are used as the major nutrient sources (Lam, M. K., et al 2011). During the growth of microalgae, researchers have noted that microalgae can extract the necessary nutrients and chemicals from different sources including wastewater. The latter represents a renewable source of nutrients and chemicals for microalgae cultivation. Wastewater is currently in use as a source of nutrients for the cultivation of microalgae when it contains a high quantity/concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus. Generally, the processes of wastewater treatment using microalgae include but are not limited to the following; the removal of nutrients, heavy metal ions, and pathogens and the reduction of biological oxygen demand (Mohd Udaiyappan, et al 2017). Most likely, the process is associated with oxygen or biogas production. Microalgae rely on the area of their surface largeness for the uptake of water, nutrients and carbon dioxide when compared to terrestrial plants that require a proper system for water and nutrient uptake (Prajapati, S. K., et al. 2013). The usage of wastewater for the cultivation of microalgae can help improve the sciences of microalgae to biofuel conversion, as well as serve as a water purifier. Microalgae are widely used in the treatment of wastewater but their usage on a large industrial scale for the production of biofuel is widely restricted (Pittman, J. K., et al 2011). Microalgae are the major microorganisms used in the domestic treatment of wastewater in units for oxidation ditches (Butler, E., et al. 2017). Surveys gotten from global wastewater data showed that by utilizing 50% of domestic and industrial wastewaters (495 billion m3) for the growth of algal, with the assumption of 0.5 g/L biomass (Fozer, D., et al. 2017) with 20% lipid content can produce roughly 50 million ton of algal biodiesel (Bhatnagar, A., et al. 2011). The actual limitation for the treatment of wastewater with an algal system is to find some ideal microalgae that can survive in a wastewater environment that has huge efficiency of nutrient and micropollutants that boosts productivity to aid in the removal of high biomass/lipid.


The significant benefit of microalgae as promising renewable biomass is noted in figure 1. Include but are not limited to the following;


Microalgae can serve as a faster and more effective source of conversion of solar energy into biomass through the process known as photosynthesis.Microalgae have proven to grow from the grounds, which rather are not engrossed for plant growing.The growth of microalgae does not require herbicides and pesticides.Microalgae can grow in a salty water environment.Microalgae can grow in a wastewater environment, thereby making use of nutrients contained therein.Microalgae can generate their heat from gas exhaust coming from heat power plants, which will serve as a source of carbon for the production of microalgae.

EXTRACTION OF HIGH-VALUE PRODUCTS FROM MICROALGAE


However, regardless of the booming interest in microalgae as a source of sustainable renewables biofuel, microalgae to biofuel conversion is controlled by economics. In our modern world, the global production of microalgae biomass industrially is about 10000 tons/year, while the cost of production is about 20-200$/kg, this result has served as a barricade to the use of microalgae as a source of biofuel (Wang, Y., et al. 2016). Reports have it that the cost of microalgae for human consumption ranges from 100 $/kg, and 5-20 $/kg for animals and feed for fish, 1-5 $/kg for the bulk chemicals and 0.4 $/kg for biofuel (Wijffels, R. H. et al 2008). Researchers have recorded that microalgae are composed of 40% lipids, 50% proteins and 10% carbohydrates. One-quarter of the generated lipids are sold to the food and chemical industry for about 2 $/kg, for biodiesel fuel at 0.5 $/kg, soluble proteins for (20%) for food at 5 $/kg, and the rest (80%) for a feed at 0.75 $/kg (Wijffels, et al 2010, Sathasivam, R., et al 2017). Just a few microalgae have commercial significance and they include Chlorella, Dunaliella, Tetraselmis, Botryococcus, Phaeodactylum, Crypthecodinium, Porphyridium, Nitzschia, Chaetoceros, Spirulina, Isochrysis, Haematococcus, Nannochloris, Schizochytrium, and Skeletonema (Sathasivam, R., et al 2017). Microalgae have been in use for decades as food and feed (Vigani, M., et al 2015). There are primarily two categories of market food products gotten from microalgae. The first set is the dried algae the Chlorella and Spirulina with great content of nutrients, most especially vitamin B12, C and D2. These products from microalgae can be sold and used as a dietary supplement and have a high potential to be used in large quantities as a source of protein and carbohydrates. The second category is a specially designed product that is added to food and feeds in others to enhance its nutritional value after its extraction from microalgae. These high worth products are pigments or carotenoids (e.g. ß-carotene, astaxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, chlorophyll, phycocyanin, phycoerythrin, fucoxanthin), antioxidants (e.g., catalases, polyphenols, superoxide dismutase, tocopherols), fatty acids (e.g. omega-3, docosahexaenoic acid – DHA, eicosapentaenoic acid – EPA and arachidonic acid – ARA), vitamins (e.g. A, B1, B6, B12, C, E, biotin, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, pantothenate, folic acid) and others (e.g. antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral agents, toxins, amino acids, proteins, sterols). The Components of algae are regularly used in cosmetics as thickening agents, water-binding agents, and antioxidants. Microalgae species are established in the skincare market, the main ones being Arthrospira and Chlorella.


The extracts gotten from microalgae can be found in face and skincare products.


MICROALGAE-TO-BIOFUEL CONVERSION METHODS


In the industrial cultivation of microalgae in large quantities, the conversion of biomass to biofuel is the most assured way in utilizing microalgal biomass. The byproducts of microalgae to biofuel conversion can be used with already existing infrastructure, e.g. it can serve as a motor fuel. Figure 2 shows the life cycle of microalgae as a source of renewable biomass. It is, however, necessary to determine an optimal method for biomass-to-biofuel conversion.


Figure 2View largeDownload slideThe life cycle of microalgae as renewable biomass for biofuel productionFigure 2View largeDownload slideThe life cycle of microalgae as renewable biomass for biofuel production Close modal


Biodiesel production


Biodiesel fuel is typically produced through transesterification of fatty carboxylic acid triacylglycerides that are contained in microalgae. The transesterification reaction between low molecular alcohols (methanol, ethanol) and fatty acids progresses in the presence of alkali or acid catalysts. The chemical absorption of biodiesel fuel is different from that the fossil oil-derived diesel. The major property of the aforementioned biodiesel fuel is its similarity to diesel. The main disadvantage of this biodiesel is its high energy consumption and also the use of deadly organic solvents like methanol. However, it is only lipids that are further converted into fuel without any contribution from microalgae biomass including proteins and carbohydrates. In recent studies, whole lots of high strain microalgae has been discovered (Steinrücken et al. 2017, Kumar, V., et al 2018, Sun, X.-M., et al 2018). Microalgae that are highly enriched with lipids usually provide low biomass yield (Lopez Barreiro, D., et al 2013, Rodofil, L., et al 2009). Results gotten from analyzing thirty different microalgae strains (freshwater and marine) (Rodofil, L., et al 2009) to determine their yield and lipid content, further showed that marine microalgae strains (Porphyridium cruentum and strains Tetraselmis) yielded the highest productivity with a small content of lipid (8.5-14.7 %).


BIOETHANOL PRODUCTION


Another alternative technique used in the production of biofuel from microalgae is bioethanol production through aerobic and anaerobic fermentation (De Farias Silva, et al 2016). In this technique, the major concentrate that encourages microalgae to ethanol formation are carbohydrates (Ho, S.-H., et al 2014, Kumar et al 2018). Microalgae strains such as Scenedesmus, Chlorella and Chlamydomonas (Ho, S.-H., et al 2013, Kim, M,-S et al 2006) can cumulate a high amount of carbohydrates with over 50% of the total mass which represents mostly starch and cellulose. Furthermore, in the case of biodiesel production, biofuel production from microalgae permits partial biomass conversion. An alternative way of obtaining a high degree of microalgal biomass conversion to biofuel is a simultaneous production of diesel and bioethanol as contributed by (Wang, H., Ji, et al 2014). This conversion technique is expensive and complicated.


BIO-OIL PRODUCTION


Immediate conversion of microalgal biomass into biofuel can be operated through a process known as pyrolysis or hydrothermal liquefaction (Chiaramonti, D., et al 2015). Either method is used in the production of liquid hydrocarbon fuel known as bio-oil. Pyrolysis is a process for oxygen-free thermochemical biomass conversion under low moisture content and a temperature of 400–600 °С (Kumar, V., et al 2016). Several scholars have researched and noted the findings on microalgae pyrolysis (Peng, W., et al 2000, Grierson, S., et al 2009, Harman-Ware, et al 2013, Francavilla, M., 2015). Depending on the rate of heating of the biomass, pyrolysis can either be "quick" or "slow" (Raheem, A., et al 2015). One significant issue associated with microalgae conversion through pyrolysis is the high moisture content demand for this biomass (80-90 %). The highest biomass moisture content acceptable for pyrolysis is about 20% (Bennion, E. P., et al 2015). Biomass with high moisture content, the HTL is perceived as a promising conversion technique, because it does not demand the drying of microalgae preliminarily. This input was suggested by the most recent scholars (pyrolysis and HTL(Chiaramonti, D., et al 2015, Bennion, E. P., et al 2015, Chiaramonti, D., 2015).


HYDROTHERMAL LIQUEFACTION OF MICROALGAE


Thermodynamic efficiency


Generally, thermochemical techniques for biomass to biofuel conversion can be categorized into dry and wet processes. Biomass to biofuel conversion methods is done in the absence of little or no oxygen. The dry processes are conveyed near atmospheric pressure which is already the dry income raw. Processes such as the traditional torrefaction, gasification and pyrolysis are all dry processes. The P-T diagram for dry and wet (hydrothermal) processes is presented in Figure 3. Torrefaction is conveyed at 200-300°C and it is utilized for the upgrading of wood biomass (Pentananunt, R., et al 1990). The target product of torrefaction is known as a solid fuel (bio-char) such as lignite. However, dry pyrolysis is carried out under a temperature of about 400-600 °C. With pyrolysis, biomass is converted into bio-oil as a major by-product along with syngas (CO + H2) and solid bio-char (Guedes, R. E., et al 2018). The gasification of biomass to the combustible gas mixture is conveyed through partial oxidization of biomass under high temperature (Sansaniwal, S. K., et al 2017), in the range of 700-850 °C. The traditional dry thermochemical conversion technique has become more economically feasible with the increase in moisture content of the biomass. For example, to dry biomass with 80% humidity to a stage of 20% humidity at atmospheric pressure, it is crucial to spend about 10 MJ of thermal energy per 1 kg of dry biomass, the calorific value of the dry biomass is about 15 MJ/kg. The consumption of energy for traditional drying becomes huge. One of the issues associated with moisture is that it will become more significant if microalgae are generally used for the sustainable development of the environment and biofuel production. Moreover, all traditional thermochemical conversion techniques that are the dry processes also need the drying step. At a large scale microalgae usage demands new technical conversion methods; the efficiency of the technique should nevertheless be sensitive to the moisture content of the biomass. To further solve the issues of thermochemical conversion of biomass with a large amount of moisture content, the hydrothermal technologies however should be increasingly employed for usage (Vlaskin, M. S., et al 2017, Chernova, N.I., et al 2017, Chernova et al 2017, Vlaskin, M.S., 2017). Generally, hydrothermal processes are used to denote processes carried out in the presence of liquid water or steam at temperatures greater than 100 °C (Byrappa, K., et al 2001). Hydrothermal processes have a broad range of applications (Byrappa, K., et al 2001, Vlaskin, M. S., et al 2018, Kislenko, S.A., et al 2016, Vlaskin, M.S., et al 2016, Zhuk, A.Z., et al 2016). In the issue of treatment of biomass, the hydrothermal process is divided into hydrothermal carbonization (target product – solid fuel, process temperature of about 250 °C.), hydrothermal liquefaction (target product–liquid fuel, process temperature in the range of 250-450 °C.) and also hydrothermal gasification (target product- gaseous fuel, process temperature greater than 450 °C.).

Hydrothermal processes are normally conveyed at high pressure. However, if the temperature of the water is below the critical temperature range, the pressure is normally maintained near the pressure that equates to the temperature of the water. An increased and high operational pressure is one of the major setbacks of hydrothermal processes. The high temperature provides the major advantage of hydrothermal treatment. Particularly, high temperature permits large thermodynamic efficiency of the process. The large thermodynamic efficiency of the hydrothermal treatment is attained by heat recovery.


Figure 4 depicts the contrasts between the two processes: the drying standards and the hydrothermal treatment (at 300 °C) of wet biomass. The T-S diagram in figure 4 shows the drying process at atmospheric pressure and the hydrothermal treatment at 300 °C with or without heat recovery. Figure 4a and 4b, illustrates the input of energy in the aforementioned processes, figure 4c, and 4d depicts the feature potential for the heat recovery process and 4e, and 4f show the input of energy in the processes of heat recovery. However, lines 1-2-3 In 4a tallies to the removal of water in the wet biomass at atmospheric pressure. The specific latent heat required to aid in the removal of water from wet biomass through drying at atmospheric pressure (heating to 100 °C and evaporation at 100 °C) is equal to h3−h1=2676−105=2571(kJ/kg), Where h3 is the enthalpy of saturated steam at 100 °C, and h1 is the enthalpy of water at standard condition. This quantity of heat equates to the shaded portion in Figure 4a. The Hydrothermal treatment of wet biomass at a temperature of 300 °C can be estimated by the heating of water conveyed in the sludge at a pressure that brings forth the maintaining of the liquid state of water (lines 1-4 in fig 4b). A specific heat that is demanded hydrothermal treatment at 300 °C is distinguished by the following difference h4−h1=1344−105=1239(kJ/kg)⁠, where h4 is the enthalpy of the liquid water at 300 °C. The quantity of heat corresponds to the shaded portion in 4b. The atmospheric drying demands two times greater energy than hydrothermal treatment at 300 °C with the same amount of moisture. However, the atmospheric drying at low-temperature steam with low recovery potential at a temperature of about 100 °C. An increasingly high enthalpy of this type of steam can be utilized for the heating of liquid water. The temperature difference of about 30 °C is normally utilized as the least gap needed for the transfer of heat from cold to some heated substances. It, therefore, means that the steam with a temperature of 100°C can be utilized for the heating of liquid water up to a temperature of about 70 °C (lines 1-2′ in Figures 4c, and 4e).

CONCLUSION


In conclusion, it has been shown that the industrial contribution of microalgal biomass can be effectively increased as a result of its global green energy application of microalgae. Specifically, these applications can be utilized in wastewater treatment, industrial mitigation of CO2 emissions, also for oxygen production and capturing of atmospheric CO2. However, the evidence has been shown that it is actively in progress in our modern world. A wide spectrum of microalgae has been applied industrially due to its green application. A significant increase in microalgae demands an effective technique for utilizing microalgal biomass. One problem associated with large scale microalgae utilization is due to its high moisture content in microalgae.
