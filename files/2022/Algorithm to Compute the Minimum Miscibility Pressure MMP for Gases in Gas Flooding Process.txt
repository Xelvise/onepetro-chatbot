Abstract


Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is important to the petroleum industry mostly because it is used to improve oil recovery. Miscible gas flooding, a type of EOR process that is proven and economically viable can significantly increase oil recovery from reservoirs. In this study, the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) in gas floods for different gases were computed using empirical correlations (Glaso correlation for hydrocarbon gas injection, Emera, Yuan et al and Glaso correlation for pure carbon dioxide gas injection, Sebastin and Yuan correlation for impure carbon dioxide correlations and Glaso, Firoozabadi and Aziz correlations for nitrogen gas injection). An efficient computer program was developed using visual basic programing language. Employing its highly versatile features, friendly graphical user interface (GUI) forms were designed and robust codes were developed. Validation was done for the program and results showed that the software which was developed had acceptable level of accuracy, was fast and effective. The study provides a new and cost effective way of checking for MMP which will enhance the process of screening gas flooding processes for the reservoir.

INTRODUCTION


Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process involves the injection of fluids into the reservoir which interacts with the system and encourages the displacement of oil to the producing well. (Lake et al., 2014; Jin, 2017; Green et al., 2018; Fanchi, 2018). There are different types of EOR processes employed in the industry and still being researched on (Delamaide et al., 2014; Rao, 2001; Sen, 2008; Taber et al., 1997; Thomas, 2006). Gas injection or gas flooding process is a method of EOR that uses gas (natural gas, nitrogen(N2) or carbon dioxide(CO2)) that expands in a reservoir to displace additional oil to the producing well (Nnaemeka, 2010).There are the miscible and immiscible gas flooding process. Miscible gas flooding is more effective in increasing recovery factor (RF) due to the presence of capillary forces in the immiscible case (Farajzadeh et al., 2010; El-hoshoudy and Desouky, 2018; Mashayekhi et al., 2018).


Minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) is the lowest pressure for which a gas can develop miscibility through a multi-contact process within a given reservoir oil at reservoir temperature. Miscibility displacement can only be achieved at pressures greater than this minimum (Moudi et al., 2009; Barati-Harooni et al., 2019). The main factors affecting MMP are: reservoir temperature, oil composition and injected gas purity (Emera and Serma, 2007). Two processes commonly used to develop miscibility during gas injection are first contact miscibility (FCM) and multi-contact miscibility (MCM). The MMP can be determined either by laboratory experiments or numerical studies. (Mansour et al., 2016; Vahid, 2021; Feng et al, 2017). Empirical correlations used for the prediction of MMP in reservoir oils with various types of gas injection provide quick estimates useful during the screening (early stages) of various gas injection processes for the reservoir. Correlations can provide preliminary evaluation and can also be used to verify other method of evaluation, it is suitable for fields with limited amount of data (Leonid et al., 2010; Eakin and Mitchell, 1988).This can also be a limitation as they are unable to capture all the variations in the MMP with regards to the physical aspects. (Karkevandi-Talkhooncheh et al., 2017). As a result, there is room to work on more generalized and robust approaches to develop universally applicable models/correlations, hence is an open area of research. (Barati-Harooni et al., 2019; Kamari et al., 2015; Mollaiy-Berneti, 2016); Chen et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2003; Sayyad et al., 2014; Shokrollahi et al., 2013; Tatar et al., 2013; Zhong and Carr, 2016). Robert et al. (1988) pointed out that any correlation should:


account for each parameter known to affect the MMP, i.e. temperature, composition of the displacing and displaced fluid;be based on thermodynamic or physical principles that affect the miscibility of fluids, and finally;be directly related to the multiple contact miscibility process.


MMP computation using empirical correlations can be tedious, slow and prone to errors when handled manually. Hence a computerized process is needed just like the many petroleum engineering softwares including those used in EOR processes which has made computations, simulation, prediction and interpretation of data to be fast and efficient. These software written using programming languages like Java, C++, Python and Visual Basic are expensive and not readily available (licensed). Visual Basic is modern, general purpose and object oriented (Dietel et al., 2014). It's easy to learn and has a very simple structure, hence it has been employed in solving problems in reservoir engineering (Akpobi and Ebojoh, 2020).


This study aims to develop an efficient algorithm to evaluate the MMP of gases used in miscible gas flooding process. Its objectives are to present relevant mathematical equations (correlations), develop a pseudocode and design a simplified flowchart. Also to design forms (GUI) for input and output and develop efficient codes in order to provide an easy, fast and cheap computerized process that has acceptable level of accuracy.


METHODOLOGY


Methods used in developing the software are outlined in the following sections


Mathematical Equations


The correlation used in developing the program were for hydrocarbon gas / oil system, nitrogen gas, pure carbon dioxide gas and impure carbon dioxide gas. The empirical correlations used were selected on the basis of accuracy and simplicity (Nnaemeka, 2010)


Hydrocarbon Gas/Oil Systems)


Glaso correlations (Glaso, 1985) for predicting MMP for hydrocarbon gas/oil systems are as follows


MMPx=34=6329.0−25.410y−z(46.745−0.185y)+T(1.127×10−12y5.258e319.8zy−1.703)(1)


MMPx=44=5503.0−19.238y−z(80.913−0.273y)+T(1.700×10−9ye3.73013.567zy−1.058)(2)


MMPx=54=7437.0−25.703y−z(73.515−0.214y)+T(4.920×10−14y5.520e21.706zy−1.109)(3)


Where:


MMP = Minimum miscibility pressure in psig;


 x = Molecular weight of C2 through C6 in the injection gas in lbm/lb-mole;


 y = Corrected molecular weight of C7+ in the stock-tank oil,


 z = Methane in injection gas in mole percent;


T = Reservoir temperature in °F.


Nitrogen Gas Injection


Nitrogen gas (N2) is available, cheap and can be combined with other gases in varying proportion for gas flooding process. Numerous correlations are available for computing its MMP. Glaso MMP correlations for nitrogen gas injection (Glaso, 1985) is given as:


For molecular weight of C7+>160, mole percent of intermediates >28, the correlation to use is


MMP=6364.0−12.090MC7++T(1.127×10−12MC7+5.258e23,025.0MC7+−1.703−20.80)(4)


For molecular weight of C7+>160 and mole percent of intermediates >28, the correlation to use is:


MMP=7695.1−12.090MC7++T(1.127×10−12MC7+5.258e23,025.0MC7+−1.703−39.77)(5)


If the mole percent of intermediates <28, the correlation to use is:


MMP=9364.0−12.090MC7++T(1.127×10−12MC7+5.258e23,025.0MC7+−1.703−20.80)−99.3C2−6(6)


Where:


MC7+ = molecular weight of the C7+ in the stock-tank oil in lbm/lb-mole;


C2-6 = mole percent of the intermediates (C2 through C6) in the reservoir oil.


Firoozabadi and Aziz Correlation


The Firoozabadi and Aziz correlation (Firoozabadi and Aziz, 1986) for prediction of MMP for nitrogen or lean gas injection is:


MMP=9433−188×103(C2−5MC7+T0.25)+1430×103(C2−5MC7+T0.25)2(7)


MMP = Minimum miscibility pressure in psia;


MC7+ = Molecular weight of C7+ in lbm/lb-mole;


C2-5 = Mole percent of C2 through C5 including CO2 and H2S in the reservoir fluid;


CO2 Gas Injection


Research showed that CO2 is a better candidate for gas flooding because it possesses the ability to develop multi-contact miscibility (MCM) with oils at lower pressures than Nitrogen, also an important source of greenhouse gas emissions which needs to be reduced from the environment (Gozalpour et al., 2005; Dindonuk et al, 2020 and 1997; Heidary et al 2016]. Robert et al. (1988), gave a list of many correlations that have been used in computing for MMP of CO2. Important parameters that could influence the MMP include temperature, oil composition and the contaminants present in the CO2.


Pure Carbon Dioxide Gas Injection


Correlations selected for the computation of MMP for impure CO2 were the Glaso correlation, Emera and Sarma correlation, and the Yuan Correlation.


Glaso Correlation


For mole composition of C2 through C6 greater >18%, the Glaso correlation (Glaso, 1985) is


MMPpure=810.0−3.404MC7++T(1.700×10−9MC7+3.730e786.8MC7+−1.058)(8)


For mole composition of C2 through C6 < than 18%, the Glasø correlation is


MMPpure=2947.9−3.404MC7++T(1.700×10−9MC7+3.730e786.8MC7+−1.058)−121.2C2−6(9)


Emera Correlation


The Emera Correlation (Emera and Serma, 2005) for pure CO2 Injection is represented as:


MMPpure=5.0093×10−5×(1.8T+32)1.164×MC5+1.2785×(CC1+N2CC2−4+H2S+CO2)0.1073(10)


If the bubble pressure (Pb) < 50 psi, the Emera correlation for pure injection becomes:


MMPpure=5.0093×10−5×(1.8T+32)1.164×MC5+1.2785(11)


Where:


MMPpure= Minimum miscibility pressure for pure CO2 in MPa;


MC5+ = Molecular weight of the C5+ in the stock-tank oil in lbm/lb-mole;


CC1+N2= mole fraction of the volatiles (C1 and N2) in the reservoir oil;


CC2−4+H2S+CO2= Mole fraction of the intermediates (C2, C3, C4, H2S, and CO2) in the oil.

Software Design and Development


The mathematical expressions for the empirical correlations in equations (1) - (16) were used to write most of the codes for the software. Employing the unique syntax that Visual Basic offers, efficient codes were developed as observed from the steps outlined in the pseudocode. The program has several forms each designed to achieve a specific objective. Figure 1 depicts a simplified flow chart for the program.

The Design of Graphical User Interface (GUI Forms)


The objective of the design of the form was for ease and simplicity. Several forms were designed for computation of MMP for hydrocarbon gas, nitrogen gas, pure carbon dioxide gas and impure carbon dioxide gas, using different correlation methods. The design was customized for each form via the property window and toolbox, it involves selection and placement of input and output labels, textboxes and control buttons. The programs opens with an introduction form page designed to give the user a summary of what the software can do as shown in Figure 2. Option of selecting the type of gas is also available. The other forms were designed each for a particular type of gas with different methods of computing for its MMP.
