Abstract


A comprehensive description of reservoir fluid properties is critical in developing solutions and resolving reservoir engineering issues. The oil formation volume factor, βo, is an indispensable reservoir fluid property in reservoir engineering calculations. In this study, we used a total of 11040 data points from 1840 oil samples to develop new βo correlations for the Nigerian crude oils specifically, and another set of correlations for the other regions herein referred to as the global crude oils. Linear regression (LR), multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple non-linear regression (MNLR), neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), and the group method of data handling (GMDH) techniques were used to develop several correlations. Results show that the GMDH method yielded the best correlation while the MNLR is the least accurate. The root means square error (RMSE) for the Nigerian, and Global correlations are 0.0033, and 0.0256 respectively. The two correlations are reliably better in terms of accuracy than the existing correlations. The new correlations would facilitate a more accurate reservoir characterization, and reliable design of surface equipment.

Introduction


The oil formation volume factor (OFVF or βo) is the ratio of the liquid volume at reservoir conditions to the liquid volume at the stock tank or standard condition (Guo, Liu & Tan, 2017). This is the factor that is used to convert reservoir barrels to stock tank barrels. The standard units of oil formation volume factor are usually expressed as units of reservoir volume over standard volume (bbl/STB). In its simplest form, the βo is defined as the ratio of oil volume in its natural resource to the amount of oil present at the surface condition (Elmabrouk, Zekri & Shirif, 2014). Because the vast majority of produced oil and gas measurements are taken at the surface, we must convert measured surface volume to reservoir volume to use this definition. Because produced oil often contains dissolved gas, the value of Bo is always larger than one.


When crude oil is produced, it will result in a decline in the amount of oil that is being produced. Shrinkage is the term used to describe this phenomenon. It is possible to determine the shrinkage of produced crude oil by utilizing the formation volume factor (Bo). This component is regarded to be one of the most significant physical features of crude oil since it is directly connected to the calculation of the crude oil, which is referred to as stock tank oil initially in place (STOIIP).


As the oil flows from the reservoir to the surface, the oil loses its dissolved gasses which were initially at high pressures and temperatures. Three interesting things occur when the oil moves from the reservoir to the surface. Firstly, as the oil moves from the reservoir to the surface, dissolved gasses tend to be lost, and thus this causes the oil to lose its mass when it finally reaches the surface. Secondly, due to the decline in temperature during this process, the oil tends to shrink. Thirdly, similar to the phenomenon of the increase in the size of a bubble of air rising from the seabed to the surface, the oil in this case also tends to expand due to pressure decline. (McCain, 1993).


Methodology and Setup


Data gathering


The preparation of appropriate data is the first stage in developing a viable model to correlate the βo. These locations include Malaysia, the Middle East, the North Sea, the United States, and Nigeria. Table 1 below states the range of data collected accordingly. All these data are combined to generate a global correlation for the βo. Hence two (2) correlations will be generated in this study: a correlation for the Nigerian crude oil and a general correlation for the global crude oils.

Data processing


A total of five (5) parameters were used as input variables or predictors in the development of the correlations. These include the bubble-point pressure (Pb), solution gas-to-oil ratio (Rs), API gravity, gas gravity (γg), and reservoir temperature (TR). The data are split into three (3) separate sets: the training set, the validation set, and the testing set, which is known as partitioning the data. Training sets are used to build models, whereas validation sets are used to guarantee that the developed models are produced most optimally, and testing sets are used to evaluate the final performance of the models.


Developing Model


MATLAB, Microsoft Excel, and software called GMDH Shell were used in this study to develop new correlations for the βo. To achieve this, five techniques were used: linear regression (LR), multiple nonlinear regression (MNLR), support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), and the group method of data handling (GMDH).


Model Analysis


The usage of graphical tool aids is used to explain the graphical error analysis and to check the new correlation's correctness and efficiency. The cross-plot approach will be the primary technique used in this study. Additionally, the mean absolute error (MAE) is used to examine this model, which is a technique for determining expected accuracy by averaging the magnitudes of projected mistakes. Additionally, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is utilized to quantify the difference between the expected and actual values. The correlation coefficient of determination (R2) is used to quantify the degree of the relationship between two factors. The accuracy of the projected system and the average absolute error (AAE) are determined using the symmetry mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE).


Results and Discussion


Data Collection


The specific gravity of the oil, the specific gravity of the gas, the solution gas-oil ratio (Rs), the temperature of the reservoir, and the bubble point pressure (Pb) were all used in this investigation (Bo). The bulk of reported correlations bases their selection of PVT data points on the input requirements of the data points. To avoid data duplication, each of the data groups was examined for duplication and cross-checked with the other data groups in sequence. Table 2 shows the range of data used in this study. These include solution gas-oil ratio (Rs), gas gravity (γg), oil gravity (API), reservoir temperature (°F), and the bubble point pressure, Pb.

After training the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in MATLAB for the Nigerian data, the model then becomes ready for the phase of testing and validation or evaluation by using the cross-validation option in the application. Note that for the Nigerian data they were segregated into groups of training (70%), validation (20%) and testing (10%). As for the application, for this data, the best turned out to be the Medium Gaussian SVM as it displayed the lowest errors and the highest accuracy among all the other SVM available in the library. The output data weights are displayed in Table 3 while the results of validation and testing can be seen in Figure 5 and Figure 6 respectively.

In terms of the R2 also the GMDH method as it shows the highest correlation and is followed by the MATLAB Support Vector Machine (SVM). This is best illustrated in Figure 11. As for the Symmetrical Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE), the best in this study also will be the GMDH method with a reading of 0.210283% while the next best would be the MNLR method with a reading of 1.000259% as illustrated in Figure 12. In terms of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) however, in this study, the MNLR method has the lowest error which is 0.010053 followed by the ANN method of 0.01586 as shown in figure 13. Results show that the best correlation for the Nigerian crude oil obtained from the GMDH method with the RMSE, R2, and SMAPE values of 0.0033, 0.9996, and 0.2102 respectively. The statistical error analyses of the new Bo compared to the previous correlations are illustrated in figures 10 to 13.

Support Vector Machine (MATLAB)


After training the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in MATLAB for the Global data, the model then becomes ready for the phase of testing and validation or evaluation by using the cross-validation option in the application. Note that Global data were segregated into groups of training (70%), validation (20%) and testing (10%). As for the application, for this data, the best turned out to be the Quadratic SVM as it displayed the lowest errors and the highest accuracy among all the other SVM available in the library. The output data weights are displayed in Table 6 while the results of validation and testing can be seen in Figure 16 and Figure 17 respectively.

Neural Network


After training the Global data on the Neural Network (NN) application, the data was also tested, and the output is shown in Table 7 below. To perform this, the data group were segregated into groups of training (70%), validation (20%) and testing (10%). The testing data was not seen by the neural network to achieve high accuracy of the final results. As for the application, for this data, the best turned out to be the Narrow NN as it displayed the lowest errors and the highest accuracy among all the other NN available in the library. The output data weights are displayed in Table 7 while the results of validation and testing can be seen in Figures 18 and 19 respectively.

Conclusion


A new set of correlations have been developed specifically for the Nigerian crude oils in one part, and for other crude oils from other regions of the world, hereby termed global correlation. The correlations obtained from the GMDH method with the least error analyses are more reliable than those derived from LR, MNLR, SVM, and the ANN. Furthermore, the GMDH correlations are found to be more accurate than Omar, Standing, Glaso, and Al-Marhoun correlations. The newly developed correlations could facilitate improved reservoir characterization and management.
