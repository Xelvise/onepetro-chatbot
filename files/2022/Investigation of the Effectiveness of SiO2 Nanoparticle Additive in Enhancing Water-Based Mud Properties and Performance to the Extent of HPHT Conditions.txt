Abstract


This study investigated the effectiveness of nano-particles, mainly silica, as an additive to water-based muds to the extent of HPHT conditions. Specifically, the study ascertained the impact of silica nano-particles in improving performance of water-based mud, the study also investigated the effect of nano-silica on mud density and also investigated the quality of silica nano-particles as a fluid loss agent and rheology modifier. The laboratory study was divided into four parts: viscosity determination, fluid loss test, sand content determination, and density determination. The experiments were conducted using water-based mud with and without silica nanoparticles. In the course of the study, the rheological, fluid loss properties, the rheological behaviour of the mud, and the cuttings transportation efficiency were directly and indirectly ascertained. From the findings, it was ascertained that nano silica improves mud viscosity, density, and also reduces yield point and fluid loss. With nano silica, the sand content of the drilling mud reduces. The effect of nanosilica in drilling fluids reduced shear stress vs. shear rate readings which could reduce the pump pressure required for mud circulation in drilling operations. Based on these findings, it is recommended that future laboratory studies be done in dynamic conditions in order to investigate the effect of drill pipe rotation on cuttings transportation improvement for water-based mud without and with nano silica.

Introduction


At High Pressures and High Temperatures (HPHT), it is exceptionally difficult to perform drilling operations. With respect to drilling liquid, the designed mud weight should be higher in HPHT wells, and should be precisely controlled in narrow mud windows. Additionally, at HTHP conditions, there is often the degradation of mud system, as it becomes unstable at high-pressure high temperature (HPHT) conditions, resulting to fluid loss. As a result of this, there is a need to improve the conventional mud systems with efficient fluid loss control additives, rheology modifying agents and weighting additives.


More recently, the use of nanoparticles in drilling fluids has shown to be potential solutions to the experienced drilling fluids issues (Rafati et al., 2018). As a result of the ultrafine size and high surface area to volume proportion of nanoparticles, drilling engineers have the ability to modify the drilling fluid rheology by adjusting the composition, type or size distribution in drilling liquids to take any unique condition when nanoparticles are utilized as additives (Smith et al., 2018). Also, because of the cost effectiveness and accessibility in huge amounts, the utilization of nanoparticles in drilling fluids has offered enormous technical and financial advantages (Abdo and Haneef, 2013). Studies by (Al-Anssari et al., 2016; Ragab and Noah, 2014; Noah et al., 2016) demonstrated that nanoparticles provide solutions like the decrease in filtration loss and friction coefficient, enhancement of drilling fluids rheological properties, gas hydrates inhibition and enhancement of shale stability. Studies have likewise demonstrated the utilization of nanoparticles in high pressure high temperature (HPHT) wells, since it elevates the yield point and electrical stability, and reduction of fluid loss (Rafati et al., 2018).


A number of laboratory studies have assessed nanosilica as a drilling fluid additive since Silica (SiO2) nanoparticles are exceptionally stable, very effective, and can work efficiently with other molecules (Abimbola et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2013). Earlier adoption of SiO2 nanoparticles were mainly with water-based mud additive and concentrated on the adjustment of rheological properties, decreasing filtration loss and friction, inhibition of shale and hydrate formations, and enhancement of heat transfer, whereas the use for mud property change/adjustment for effective wellbore cleaning and particularly cutting transfer has remained unclear. Therefore, this study formulated a water-based mud containing SiO2 nanoparticle additive in the Lab to ascertain the effect and efficiency on wellbore cleaning and the extent to which SiO2 nanoparticles enhance the mud properties and performance. The study was done to validate the reports in the literature and also confirm specifically the extent of the improvement in mud drilling parameters and performance attributed to SiO2 nanoparticles.

Discussion





Mud Density


From Figure 5, the effect of nano silica improved the mud weight by 1.92 percent. This implies that nano silica can be used to increase the drilling fluid density. This in turn will increase the hydrostatic gradient in the well bore so that the pressure in the well bore is higher than formation pressure.

Sand Content


With nano silica, the sand content reduced by .01% (see Figure 6). High sand content causes excessive abrasion of pump parts and pipe connections, hence the use of nano silica is very desirable.


Figure 6View largeDownload slideSand content variation with nano silicaFigure 6View largeDownload slideSand content variation with nano silica Close modal


Rheological Property


From Figure 7, at 600 RPM, the rheology of the mud improved by 6.45% with nano silica, at 300 RPM, the mud rheology improved by 2.041% with nano silica, at 200 RPM, the mud rheology improved by 28.82%, at 100RPM, the rheology of the mud improved by 51.89%, at 60 RPM, the mud rheology improved by 55%, at 30 RPM, the mud rheology has its most significant improvement of 215.7% and at 6 RPM, the rheology improved by 56.25%. The implication of this is that nano silica generally increases the molecular weight of the mud at the different shear rates and this means that with nano silica, the efficiency of the removal of drilled cuttings to the surface of the well to maintain safe and profitable drilling operations by the mud is significantly improved with nano silica. Obviously, settling of solid particles in drilling fluids represents a major problem.

Gel Strength


Gel strength measurement was made on viscometer using the 3-rpm reading, which were recorded after stirring the drilling fluid at 600 rpm to break gel. The first reading was noted after the mud is in a static condition for 10 seconds. The second reading and the third reading were after 10 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively. Low gel strength indicates inability to suspend cuttings. It can lead to pipe stuck and hole pack off due to insufficient cutting suspension. From Figure 8, it can be seen that at 10 sec, the nano silica improved the mud gel strength by 53.85%, same as in 10 mins and after 30 mins, the gel strength of the mud was improved by 50%. This implies that with nano silica, the ability of the drilling mud to suspend drill solid and weighting material when circulation is ceased is improved significantly. It is also good to note that excessive gel strength will lead to high pump initiation pressure to break circulation after mud is in a static condition for a period of time. High pump pressure may result in formation fracture and lost circulation; hence optimization is needed here.

Plastic Viscosity


From Figure 9, there was a remarkable increase in plastic viscosity with the use of nano silica. The plastic viscosity increased by 87.5% with nano silica. According to Abdo and Haneef (2013), the mechanism behind this observation can be attributed to the decrease in bentonite in the mud as a result of the presence of nano-silica. This leads to reduction in solid particles which decreases the interaction of clay minerals (Kevin & Mahmud, 2019). Increasing the plastic viscosity of the mud results in a remarkable increase in the amount of recovered cuttings. Though, optimization is also needed here as a very high plastic viscosity generates higher resistance in mud which in turns will affect cutting lifting performance. Also, a low PV indicates that the mud is capable of drilling rapidly because of the low viscosity of mud exiting at the bit.


Figure 9View largeDownload slidePlastic viscosity variation with nano silicaFigure 9View largeDownload slidePlastic viscosity variation with nano silica Close modal


Apparent Viscosity


From Figure 10, the apparent viscosity of the mud increased by 6.8% with nano silica. Drilling mud is used to assist the drilling of wellbore into the earth. The mud viscosity is a very important property, as cuttings will settle to the bottom of the well if the viscosity is too low. Fluids that have elevated viscosities are efficient for wellbore cleaning. Hence, the presence of nano silica improves the wellbore cleaning efficiency of the mud.


Figure 10View largeDownload slideApparent viscosity variation with nano silicaFigure 10View largeDownload slideApparent viscosity variation with nano silica Close modal


Yield Point


Figure 11 shows that the yield point reduced by 2.9% with nano silica. Yield Point (YP) is resistance of initial flow of fluid or the stress required in order to move the fluid. Therefore, with nano silica, this resistance to initial flow is reduced. According to Sedaghatzadeh et al. (2016), the mechanism behind the observed reduction in yield point can be attributed to the repulsive nature of the nano-silica with the water phase and other solid clay particles. This repulsive nature prevents the occurrence of flocculation as a result of high temperatures, which can lead to issues like pump pressure loss, which could in turn cause the requirement for an increased pressure for the drilling fluid to pump the flocculated particles through the wellbore (Kevin & Mahmud, 2019). It is good to also point out the pros of high yield strength. A high YP implies a non-Newtonian fluid, one that carries cuttings better than a fluid of similar density but lower YP. Hence, optimization of the yield point is needed.

Fluid Loss


As expected, as nano silica improves mud viscosity and density, it also reduces fluid loss. At 5 mins, the fluid loss is reduced by 27.5%, at 10 mins there was fluid loss reduction of 36%, at 15 mins, there was 27.14% reduction in fluid loss, at 20 mins, there was 17.5% reduction in fluid loss, at 25 mins, there was 42.9% reduction in fluid loss, at 30 mins, there was 27% reduction in fluid loss, at 35 mins, there was a 29.2% reduction in fluid loss. At 40 and 50 mins, there were 28.3% reduction in fluid loss.


CONCLUSION


From the study findings, the following conclusions were made:


Nano silica improves mud viscosity, density, and also reduces yield point and fluid loss.With nano silica, the sand content of the drilling mud reduces.The effect of nanosilica in drilling fluids reduced shear stress vs. shear rate readings which could decrease the pump pressure needed for mud circulation in drilling operations, particularly when heavy mud is needed to drill deep formations to balance formation pressures.Well distribution of nanosilica particles in the mud disrupts excessive gel formation between gelling agents. This gel disruption reduces the attractive forces which is crucial for heavy muds and reduces progressive gels.Particle distribution of nanosilica in flowing mud increases cuttings transport and hole cleaning efficiency. This is as a result of the mud flowing in a turbulent condition to the surface, the effect of nanosilica in dispersed form which possesses high surface area to volume ratio increases the interaction with drilled cuttings and enhances colloidal forces.Silica nanoparticles has the capacity to enhance the drilled cuttings lifting performance in degraded mud since it decreases the degradation of rheological properties and as a result enhance lifting capacity of the mud as against mud with no nanosilica.


In the future, laboratory studies should be done in dynamic conditions as the present study was done in a static condition. In such dynamic laboratory study, the influence of drill pipe rotation on cuttings transportation enhancement for water-based mud with and with no nano silica can be explored. Future studies can also concentrate on exploring the cuttings transportation efficiency in varying hole inclinations and with and with no varying pipe rotations.
