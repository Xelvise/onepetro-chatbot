Abstract


The search for suitable biodiesel for formulating oil based muds for deep high-temperature wells, deviated offshore wells and sensitive shale formation have intensified over the years. The reasons behind the continuous search are in two folds. First, conventional diesel used in formulating oil-based muds are fossil based, costly, non-renewable and detrimental to environment. Secondly, previous attempts to use biodiesels proved to be more expensive than the conventional diesel.In this study, biodiesel was produced from oil extracted from Lagenaria siceraria seeds. The suitability of using the synthesized Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel in oil-based muds was evaluated. The evaluation involved comparing the properties of the synthesized Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel and its drilling muds against those of the conventional diesel and some commonly used plant seed oil based biodiesels. In addition, the economic viability of the use of the synthesized Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel in oil-based muds was evaluated and compared against those of the conventional diesel and the commonly used plant seed oil based biodiesels.The physiochemical properties of the synthesized Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel showed that it has a better potential to replace the conventional diesel. Result of mud properties and toxicity tests also showed that the synthesized Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel has a better potential to replace the conventional diesel. Although, conventional diesel is cheaper than the Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel and the commonly used plant seed oil based biodiesels, economic analysis showed that it is cost effective to use the Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel.

Introduction


The drilling fluid is one of the major key factor vital to success of any rotary drilling operation. According to Bourgoyne et al, (1991); IADC, (2000); Rabia, (2001); Amoco, (2002); Baker Hughes, (2006); Azar and Robello, (2007); IPIECA/OGP, (2009); Johannes, (2015); Gandhi and Sarkar (2016); Azuokwu et al, (2019a); Samuel and Leon (2020); Siddharth et al., (2021) the principal reasons for using drilling fluids are to:


Remove cuttings from wellborePrevents formation fluid flow into the wellMaintain wellbore stabilityCools and lubricates the drill bit and drill stringTransmits hydraulic horsepower to the bit.


Several types of drilling fluids are available for drilling oil and natural gas wells. The key factors that usually determine the type of drilling fluid selected for a specific well are safety, cost, lithology, range of temperature and pressure of the formation, borehole depth, logistics, technical performance and environmental impact (Petro Wiki, 2015; Gandhi and Sarkar, 2016; Akram et al., 2018; Mark, 2019). However, the two main types of drilling muds that are widely used during drilling operations are the water-based drilling muds (WBMs) and oil-based drilling muds (OBMs).


Water-based drilling muds are cheap and environmentally friendly. Oil based muds are used effectively in lithology and wells that are adverse to water based muds (Fadairo et al., 2012; Abduo et al., 2016; Igbafe et al., 2021). The lithology and wells include water-sensitive shale that can lead to shale hydration; deep, high-temperature holes that dehydrate water-based mud; and sensitive producing zones that can easily by damaged by water based drilling fluids and directional wells that lead stuck pipe.


There are wide variety of oils that can be used to formulate oil- based muds of which fossil-based diesel is the most common. The use of fossil-based diesel oil in drilling fluids however, have been proven to be quite expensive, non-sustainable and detrimental to environment (Fadairo et al., 2012; Tharmaraj et al., 2014; Abdul et al., 2014; Igbafe et al., 2020; Paswan and Mahto 2020; Udeagbara et al, 2021). Consequently, studies have been focused on the search for suitable plant seed oil and biodiesel that can be used in place of fossil based diesel (El Fakharany et al., 2017; Onuh et al., 2019; Saket et al., 2020; Sheeraz et al.,2020; Ashraf et al., 2021).


The search for suitable biodiesel for replacing fossil-based diesel oil used in formulating oil based muds for deep high-temperature wells, deviated offshore wells and sensitive shale formation have intensified over the years. Different researchers have conducted different studies to evaluate the effectiveness of oil based muds formulated plant based Biodiesels. The notable among the most recent studies are shown in Table 1.

There are many reasons behind the continuous search for suitable biodiesel for the replacement of the fossil-based diesel (Ashraf et al., 2021; Aboulrous et al., 2022). Notable among the reasons are:


Previous attempts to use plant-based oils and biodiesels proved to be more expensive than the Fossil based diesel oil.Direct usage of plant oils in drilling mud though showed some beneficial properties, they are thermally and hydrolytic unstable and have excessive viscosity.Apart from cost, biodiesels tend to have other shortcomings. The shortcomings of biodiesel in drilling mud systems are related to the chemical reactivity and the interactions with other additives. The hydrolysis tendency of biodiesels is remarkably affected by the presence of base catalysts. In addition, performances of the biodiesels are significantly affected by temperature.


In this study, biodiesel was synthesized from oil extracted from locally available but underutilized Lagenaria siceraria seeds. The suitability of using the synthesized Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel in oil-based muds was then evaluated. Lagenaria siceraria (Calabash/ bottle gourde) is a member Cucubitacea family. Cucubitacea family is among the abundant crop domesticated and grown at wild in most tropics especially in Nigeria (Ibrahim et al, 2016). Calabash/ bottle gourdes are grown mainly grown in rural settlement and are as container and storage vessels (Ibrahim et al, 2016). Their fruits contain vast number of seeds that have no commercial application in the locality they were produced (Ibrahim et al, 2016).


METHODS


Sourcing and Preparation of Lagenaria siceraria seeds


Matured Lagenaria siceraria fruits were sourced from Emu Unor in Ndokwa West Local Government Area of Delta State. The fruits were manually cut with a sharp knife and the seeds were separate them from the fruits. The seeds were then sun-dried; the dried seeds were dehulled and pulverized in the laboratory.


Extraction of Lagenaria siceraria seeds oil


Oil was extracted from the pulverized Lagenaria siceraria seeds using Soxhlet method with hexane as solvent. The oil was extracted in line with the procedures described by Yerima et al., (2022).


Oil yields were calculated using equation (1)


Yield %=W1 −W2W1 ×100(1)


Where: W1=Sample weight before extraction and W2= sample weight after extraction


Production of Biodiesel from Lagenaria siceraria seeds oil


The Lagenaria siceraria seeds oil biodiesel was produced through transesterification (equation 2) in the laboratory (Figure 2). Methanol (200ml) was added to 1.00g of NaOH in a conical flask with a slight heating and slow stirring until completely dissolved forming sodium methoxide. The sodium methoxide was added to Lagenaria siceraria seeds oil (100ml) heated up at 65°C in the transesterification reactor. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for two hours. The reactions converts the triglycerides in the Lagenaria siceraria seeds oil to Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) and glycerol. After this, the mixture is then cooled for three hours in a separating funnel. The mixture separated into two distinct layers, with the upper light layer containing the biodiesel (FAME) and the denser glycerol layer at the bottom. The glycerol layer (the lower layer) was thereafter tapped off. The recovered biodiesel was purified by neutralizing it diluted acetic acid and washed with distilled water. The biodiesel yield was calculated using equation (3).

Physiochemical Properties


The physicochemical properties of biodiesel were determined in line with the standard procedures of American Society for Testing of Materials (ASTM, 2005) and Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC, 2000).


Formulation, Testing and Comparison of Mud properties


Oil based muds were formulate and tested in accordance with the American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice (API, 2005).


The Lagenaria Siceraria biodiesel-based drilling fluid (LSBBDF) and fossil diesel-based drilling fluid (FDBDF) were prepared as follows: O/W = 80/20; Primary Emulsifier (10 g); Bentonite (25g); lime (1.75 g); Carboxymethyl Cellulose (7.5 g); Secondary Emulsifier (5 g) and barite to required density.


The following mud properties tests were determined:


Mud weight tests – mud weight.Mud rheological tests - Plastic viscosity (PV), Yield point (YP), Gel strength, Apparent viscosity (AV), Flow index (n).Gel strength tests - Gel Strength, (10 secs.) and Gel Strength, (10 mins.), thixotropy.Filtration tests- Fluid loss, Filter Cake Thickness.Mud pH tests.Electrical Stability tests.Lubricity tests.


Mud Toxicity Test and Environmental Impacts


The toxicity test was done in accordance to those found in literature (Abu et al., 1991; Abdul et al., 2014; Arina et al., 2015; Augustine et al., 2021) with some modifications. Locally sourced tiger prawn (Penaeus Monodon) was used in this study. Ten prawns were exposed to 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 and 200,000 ppm of the LSBBDF and (FDBDF) respectively for 96 hours and the observation was done throughout the period. The mud concentration that killed 50% of exposed prawns after 96 hours of exposure (Lethal Concentration. LC50) was identified and noted. As stated by Ogeleka and Tudararo-Aherobo (2013), an organism (Pawn) is assumed dead when there is total lack of movement or response after repeated prodding with a probe.

Based on the Table 3, the following can be deduced:


Specific gravity: it shows the weight and density of base-fluid. The specific gravity value of the Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel is within the ASTM limits of biodiesel. The value is comparable to those of the previously studied biodiesels and better than that of the fossil diesel. Based on the specific gravity values in table 3, Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel is very suitable to be used in drilling fluid.Kinematic viscosity: it shows the resistance of base fluid to flow under the influence of gravity force. Low viscosity is an ideal property for oils to be used in drilling in a range of well conditions and in different environments (Shell, 2019). Low viscosity results in a better equivalent circulating density (ECD), faster drilling rate and increased hole cleaning efficiency (Shell, 2015). The Kinematic viscosity value of the Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel is within the standard specification values (ASTM D6751 Biodiesel requirement and Standard base oil requirement). The value is comparable to those of the previously studied biodiesels and better than that of the fossil diesel. Thus, Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel is very suitable to be used as a replacement for fossil diesel in drilling fluid.Flash point and Fire point: Flash point shows the temperature at which the fluid begins to burn and Fire point shows the temperature at which oil vapour will continue to burn when ignited at the temperature. Relatively high flash point, are ideal properties for oils to be used in drilling in a range of well conditions and in different environments (Shell, 2015) for safety reasons. The flash point and fire point values of the Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel are within the standard specification values (ASTM D6751 Biodiesel requirement and Standard base oil requirement). The values are comparable to those also comparable to those of the previously studied biodiesels and better than that of the fossil diesel. Thus, Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel is very suitable to be used as a replacement for fossil diesel in drilling fluid.Pour point: it shows the lowest temperature at which the base-fluid will be able to flow. Low pour point is an ideal property for oils to be used in drilling in a range of well conditions and in different environments (Shell, 2019). The pour point value of the Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel is within the standard specification values. The value is comparable to those of the previously studied biodiesels and that of the fossil diesel. Thus, Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel is very suitable to be used in drilling fluid.Cloud point: Dissolved solids in the oil are no longer completely soluble in it at this temperature thus precipitating as a second phase giving the fluid a cloudy appearance. The cloud point of the biodiesel produced from Lageneria sinceraria seed oil is within the specified value. Thus, Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel is very suitable to be used in drilling fluid.Acid number; it is a measure of free fatty acids in a given product (Atabani et al., 2013). Acid number of the biodiesel produced from Lageneria sinceraria seed oil indicates that it contains higher fatty acid composition of 0.46 mgKOH/g but is within the ASTM specified range (0 -0.50 max).The percentage yields, (35% and 78%) for the oil and for the biodiesel respectively) are the added advantage.


DRILLING PROPERTIES RESULTS


Comparison of Mud Weight:Figure 3 showed that mud formulated with Lagenaria Siceraria biodiesel has slightly higher mud weight. This is due to the high specific gravity of the Lagenaria Siceraria seed oil (Table 3). However, all the muds met the API specification range of 8.5- 9.60 (lb/gal). However, mud formulated with Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel has slightly higher mud weight.

The mud pH: Viscosities of drilling fluids are affected. A pH of 8.5 to 9.5 is the best for hole stability and control over other mud properties (Azuokwu et al, 2019b). The pHs of the oil drilling fluids are within the permissible industry standard (Figure 4).

Rheological properties


Rheological properties are vital in determining the cuttings carrying index (CCI) and cuttings suspending index (CSI). The relationship between shear stress and shear rate shown in Figure 5, indicate non-Newtonian fluids patterns.

Plastic and Apparent Viscosity


As shown in Figure 6, the plastic and apparent viscosity values of the muds were within the API specification (Fadairo et al., 2021). Mud formulated with Lagenaria Siceraria biodiesel, however, had a slightly higher plastic and apparent viscosity values. This is can be adduced to high viscosity of the Lagenaria Siceraria biodiesel.


Figure 6View largeDownload slideComparison of Plastic and Apparent ViscosityFigure 6View largeDownload slideComparison of Plastic and Apparent Viscosity Close modal


Yield Point: The yield point (YP) indicates the ability of a drilling fluid to carry cuttings out of the annulus Okorie et al., 2015; Azuokwu et al, 2019b). Non-Newtonian fluids are drilling fluids with high yield points (Okorie et al., 2015; Azuokwu et al., 2019c). They lift cuttings better than fluids of similar density but lower YP. As shown in Figure 7, drilling mud with Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel has higher yield point, thus, can carry cuttings better than that of the fossil based diesel oil mud. The yield points of the muds is within the API specification range (15- 25).

Flow index (n):Figure 8 showed that of mud formulated with Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel has higher flow index than that of the fossil diesel. Hence, Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel can be used as a replacement for the fossil-based diesel oil.

Comparison of the Gel Strengths: The gel strength is a property of drilling fluid that indicate the ability of the drilling mud to suspend drill solid (drilled cuttings) and weighting material when mud circulation is stopped (Azuokwu et al, 2019). Figure 9 showed that mud formulated with Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel has a higher gel strength. Therefore, it could be used to replace the fossil-based diesel oil.

Fluid Loss and Mud Cake Thickness:Figure 10 showed that fluid loss and mud cake thicknessof mud formulated with conventional diesel is higher. Thus, Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel can effectively be used in place of fossil diesel oil.

Electrical Stability: The electrical stability number represents the mud emulsion stability. The higher it is; the more the stable the emulsion as as the reservoir temperature increases (Igbafe et al., 2021). Figure 11 showed that mud formulated with Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel higher electrical stability than that of the conventional diesel oil. Therefore, it can be used in place of the fossil-based diesel oil.

Lubricity Coefficient: A lubricity coefficient of less than coefficient < 0.1 is ideal for oil-based mud. Based on the lubricity coefficient results (Figure 12), Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel is very suitable to replace fossil-based diesel in drilling muds.

Mud Toxicity Results


Table 4 shows the toxicity rating and the results of mud toxicity test. From the results, it can be observed the mud concentration that can killed 50% of exposed prawns exposed to muds formulated with Lagenaria siceraria Biodiesel after 96 hours of exposure (Lethal Concentration. LC50) is more than 100,000 ppm. This means muds formulated with Lagenaria siceraria Biodiesels can be considered as non-toxic unlike muds formulated with fossil-based diesel. The results (Table 4 and Figure 13) showed that drilling mud with Lagenaria siceraria Biodiesels are more environmentally friendly than those formulated with fossil diesels are.

Economic Viability Results


A simple economic viability analysis was carried out based on propositions and data of other authors (Haas et al., 2006; Santana et al., 2014; Tasic et al., 2014; Prabodh and Jason, 2014; Acevedo et al., 2015; Amorin et al., 2015; Emmanuel et al., 2020; Vajiheh et al., 2020). However, there were some modifications due current market surveys and local operating conditions. Table 5 showed the data for the economic viability analysis.

Although this cost this a bit higher than the average price of Fossil Diesel of 2.68 U.S dollars per Gallon. It is cheaper than the Biodiesel (B100) that sold for a mean retail price of 3.73 per Gallon (Sönnichsen, 2022)

Cost of Mud Formulations and Drilling Muds Wastes Disposals


The cost of transportation of drilling wastes to disposal site is $3/bbl. while the cost of commercial disposal of the fossil-based diesel mud wastes is $57/bbl. (Ihenacho et al., 2015). Assuming two third of the fossil based diesel mud wastes disposal cost will apply to that of Lagenaria Siceraria Biodiesel due its low toxicity, it means that $38/bbl will be needed.


Thus, the cost of transportation and disposal of fossil-based diesel mud wastes will be $60/bbl. While that of Lagenaria Siceraria Biodiesel will be $41/bbl. As shown in Table 8, the formulation fossil based diesel mud and the disposal of tis wastes will be $186.14/bbl. While Lagenaria Siceraria Biodiesel will be $178.23/bbl. Thus, it is cost effective to use the Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel.

Conclusions


Based on results of this study, the following can be concluded:


Reasonable amount of oil (35%) was extracted from Lagenaria siceraria seeds.Lagenaria siceraria seeds oil is suitable for the synthesis of biodiesel (78% yield).The physiochemical properties of the synthesized Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel showed that it has a better potential to replace the conventional diesel.Result of mud properties and toxicity tests also showed that the synthesized Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel has a better potential to replace the conventional diesel.Although, conventional diesel is cheaper than the Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel and the commonly used plant seed oil based biodiesels, economic analysis showed that it is cost effective to use the Lagenaria siceraria biodiesel. This due to the exra cost of disposing drilling mud wastes
