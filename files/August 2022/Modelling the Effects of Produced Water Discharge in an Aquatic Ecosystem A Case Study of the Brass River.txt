Abstract


Produced Water (PW) constitutes a major waste from the production and processing of crude oil, consequently posing a major concern for the environment. Location of the production facility poses a greater risk to environment as this affects how the PW will be handled. Whilst many companies have come up with technologies and processes for the treatment and re-use of PW, treatment and disposal is still a common practice, particularly in the offshore environment.This study demonstrates that the Streeter-Phelps model (S-P model) can be used to evaluate the effect of produced water discharged on water bodies. This was done by comparing the result of an Environmental Evaluation Studies (EES) performed on the Brass River with the S-P model result. Similar trends/results were obtained, implying that the S-P model can be applied for quick determination of the effect on a river. This is important and useful for quick determination of the effect of the PW discharge in real-time and economically.

Introduction


Brass Terminal is located in Twon Brass Community in Brass Local Government Area of Bayelsa State in Nigeria, whose main occupation of the people is fishing and palm oil production. The Terminal is also separated from Brass Town by the man-made Brass Canal, which is parallel to the beach and about 1.57km long and 65m wide, stretching in the East-West direction. The canal is tidal, being influenced directly by the tidal regime of Brass River. Brass Terminal was commissioned in 1973. It comprises of a tank farm of 3,558,000 barrels storage capacity, 2 single mooring-buoys for loading tankers as production assets, crude oil skimming unit, office and residential accommodation. The facility receives crude oil produced by a majoy International Oil Company (IOC) from Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers and Imo states and serves as the processing point for the crude oil prior to shipment.


The facility has been in operation for about 43years. During this period, effluent/process water is discharged into an effluent canal within the vicinity. This has brought about several disputes between the host commutity and the terminal operators. Whilst this practice has stopped thanks to the commissioning of a water injection project that ensures all produced water are injected into the reservoir, the host community claimed to have been experiencing a decline in fishes and farm produce and have attributed this decline to the effect of of the produced water been discharged into the canal connected to the Brass River. On the otherhand, the company involved have demonstrated that the produced water was always preoperly treated and met discharge limits and have done proper monitoring and assessment of the area as per legislative requirements. The application of Streeter-Phelps mathematical model and the application of mass balance approach to can be used as an independent and reliable method to determine, if there exists, the effects of the inorganic pollutants in Brass River due to discharge of produced water from the oil terminal, through the Brass canal and eventual entry into the Brass River.

Statement of Theory and Definitions


Produced Water Management Philosophy


Produced water is a combination of the formation water and chemicals used to enhance production and it's the highest form of waste generated in oil and gas production activities, it can be up to 80% during production of natural gas from gas reservoirs (Neff and others, 2011). The global daily production of produced water is about 250million barrels from oil and gas activities and about 40% of this wastewater is discharged into the environment (Igunnu and Chen, 2012).


In Nigeria the average oil to formation water ratio over time is 1:1 and about 1billion barrels of produced water are disposed annually from oil and gas production activities into the environment (Chikwe and Okwa, 2016). Since the discovery of oil in Nigeria and the subsequent production of same, Nigeria has become essentially dependent on petroleum, needing more than 70% of revenue from oil sales to fund her annual budget, making Nigeria a mono economy (Itumo, 2016).


Components of produced water typically includes:


Residual hydrocarbonsHeavy metalsDissolved solidsSuspended solidsChemicals used during the oil and gas productionOrganic and inorganic speciesNaturally occurring radioactive materials


Among these components, in offshore and onshore oil and gas operations, oil & grease and salt content (in form of conductivity, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and salinity) of oilfield produced water are of great concern and require more attention, as the salinity of most oilfield produced water is usually higher than that of seawater (EPA 2004; Joel et al, 2010).


Managing produced water in the Oil & Gas industry involves the application of three main methods of pollution prevention standard practices;


Employing technologies to minimize the production of produced waterReuse and recyclingIf neither of the above is achievable, then Disposal can be considered.


For produced water to be disposed, it must have undergone different levels of treatment comprising of Primary, Secondary and Tertiary; with each level having unique processes involved. The below figure will summarize these 3 levels of treatment of produced water prior disposal:

Produced Water Management at Brass Oil Terminal


Brass Oil Terminal receives crude oil with a water-cut of about 40%. The Crude Oil is channeled to a dedicated Gun Barrel where oil is separated from produced water by gravity. The produced water is then sent for further treatment before it is discharged through the Brass canal into the Brass River. The waste water is treated to meet legislative & environmental limits before it is discharged into the river, the sludge is evacuated by third party contractor for off-site treatment and disposal.


The treatment process follows a system that aligns with the earlier mentioned 3 levels and is described in the diagram below:

Legal and Administrative Framework


Nigeria recognizes both national and international legal and administrative frameworks that guide the environment. These legal frameworks are meant to be minimum requirements for operation in the Nigerian environment. The following are some of these legal and administrative frameworks:


The regulations and policies for Environmental protection in Nigeria include:The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act No.86 of 1992Environmental Guidelines and Standards for the Petroleum industry in Nigeria, 2018Mineral Oils Safety Regulations, 1997FEPA EIA Procedural Guidelines, 1995S.I.9–National Environmental Protection (Pollution Abatement in Industries and Facilities Generation Wastes)S.I.15–National Environmental Protection (Management of Solid and Hazardous Wastes) Regulations of 1991The Petroleum Act No.51 of 1969The Petroleum Drilling and Production Regulations–1969The Oil Pipeline Act and Oil and Gas Pipeline Regulation of 1995Land Use Act of 1978Factory Act, 1992Revised National Health Policy, 2004National Health Act, 2005National Guidelines and Standards for Environmental Protection, 1991Federal Environmental Protection Agency, Act No. 58, 1988National Policy on the environment, 1989National Guidelines and Standards for Environmental Pollution Control in Nigeria, 1990


Particular attention is to be paid on the Environmental Guidelines and Standards for the Petroleum industry in Nigeria (EGASPIN, 2018) saddled with the responsibility to regulate oil and gas activities in Nigeria. The regulation on the discharge of produced water as proscribed by the EGASPIN is as follows:


PART III (E) SECTION 3.6.2


Disposal of Produced Formation Water


Inland/Near-shore AreaProduced formation/oily waters shall not be discharged into inland and near-shore areas. The disposal options are injection into disposal wells or re-injection to reservoir (sub-surface stratum or strata) approved for the purpose.Offshore/Deep-watersProduced formation/oily waters may be discharged into offshore and deepwater areas provided the following conditions are satisfied;An Oily water treatment system, designed to maintain the treatment efficiency during load variations and to operate with minimum chemical addition, shall be installed;The oil shall be separated from the produced/oily water;As a minimum, the concentration of the dispersed oil in the water to be discharged, shall not exceed 40mg/l (monthly average, otherwise the produced formation/oily waters shall be re- injected).

Modeling the Possible Effects of Produced Water on Brass River


Streeter-Phelps model follows the principle of SELF PURIFICATION of a streamWhen waste water is discharged into river or stream, the BOD of mix increases initially and DO level starts fallingAs the river travels further, BOD gradually reduces and DO increases and reaches its saturation level, thus the river gets purified on its own. This phenomenon is known as Self-Purification of stream.

When pollutional load is discharged into the stream, the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) in the stram goes on reducing. This process is known as deoxygenation. It depends on organic matter present and temperature.The variation or depletion of DO is represented graphically by Deoxygenation curve.At the same time oxygen gets added into the stream through various processes such as photosynthesis, rains etc.The curve representing oxygen gaining process is known as Reoxygenation or Reaeration curve. It depends on advection. In a flowing polluted stream deoxygenation and reaeration processes go hand in hand.

The Streeter–Phelps equation can be represented by:


D=K′BODLK′2−K′(e−K′(x/v)−e−K′2′(x/v)+Doe−K′2′(x/v))


where:


D is the dissolved oxygen concentration deficit (value below saturation) in mg/L,


K′2 is the re-aeration constant (in day-1),


K' is the BOD rate constant for oxidation (day-1),


BODL is the ultimate BOD (in mg/L),


x is distance downstream from the point source (in miles or kilometers),


v is average water velocity (in miles/day or kilometers/day but units must be compatible with distances, x), and


Do is the initial oxygen deficit of the mixed stream and wastewater (in mg/L).


To apply the above equation, we need to first get real data representing the character of the water body of interest.

Applicaltion of Streeter-Phelps Equation on the Brass Canal


To get a more realistic DO value of the effluent as it enters the Brass River from the canal, it is pertinent to model the canal (1572 m) separately using the data on Table 5.2. However, due to some limitations in available data, some realistic assumptions have been made to facilitate the modeling of the dissolved oxygen for the canal. Assumptions include:


The Effluent and canal have same BOD parametersThe effluent temperature is > Canal TemperatureThe length of the canal is 1572mThe canal flow rate is same as effluent discharge rate

Mass Balance for Inorganic Pollutants in the Brass River


The inorganic pollutants were derived using the mass balance equation:


Input = Output + Accumulation – Decay


Assuming a steady state condition (No decay & Accumulation), then


Input rate = Output rate


Therefore;


CeQe + CrQr = CmQm


and


Qm= Qe + Qr


Presentation of Data and Results


From the model results for the Canal, the minimum DO is 2.20 mg/L at the end of the canal (entry point to the Brass River at 1572m). The DO trend vs. distance is shown in Figure A-6 below:


Figure A-6View largeDownload slidePlot of DO curve for Brass CanalFigure A-6View largeDownload slidePlot of DO curve for Brass Canal Close modal


From the model, results for the River shows that as the effluent enters the river with a DO of 2.2 mg/L, there was a quick dilution with the Brass River and after 3 seconds, the DO of the river was able to self-purify, thus there was negligible effect in the Brass River. The DO trend vs. time is shown in Figure A-7, while the DO trend vs. distance is shown in Figure A-8.

According to Fondriest Environmental (2013), if dissolved oxygen concentrations drop below a certain level, fish mortality rates will rise. Sensitive freshwater fish like salmon can't even reproduce at levels below 6 mg/L. In the ocean, coastal fish begin to avoid areas where DO is below 3.7 mg/L, with specific species abandoning an area completely when levels fall below 3.5 mg/L. Below 2.0 mg/L, invertebrates also leave and below 1 mg/L even benthic organisms show reduced growth and survival rates.


We can infer that some sensitive fishes which were once in the Brass River close to our operation area might have migrated to other areas over time, affecting the socio-economic life of the Twon-Brass community people whose major occupation is fishing.


Conclusions


Within the limits of the Streeter-Phelps and Mass Balance models, the assumptions made and the quality of the data used, I can conclude that:


Due to similar trend in results obtained using the models and data from EES, we have found that the Streeter-Phelps model can be applied for quick determination of DO level of a river.There was no significant effect of the effluent from the canal to the river due to rapid self-purification of the river.However, further analysis may be necessary to investigate the effect of the effluent in the soil and ground water below the canal.
