Abstract


Over the years, multilateral well technology has been one of the most rapidly evolving and widely utilized production technologies for new and maturing reservoirs. Multilateral wells have the potential for reservoir productivity improvement. The characteristics used to evaluate multilateral well completion are connectivity, isolation, and accessibility. All these focus on the completion design of the main bore, lateral bores, and junctions that connect the lateral and main bores. Hence, one of the factors to consider in designing multilateral wells is the junction type, which depends on the required degree of mechanical integrity and pressure integrity at each lateral. Previous studies establish that the lateral junctions are a critical element of multilateral completions and can fail under formation stresses, temperature-induced forces, and differential pressures during production. Thus, the reliability of a multilateral completion design is the ability to construct and complete the multilateral junction successfully. The Technology Advancement of Multilaterals (TAML) has categorized the distinct types of multilateral junctions based on support and hydraulic integrity provided at the junction. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to provide a detailed discussion on each classification level and the conditions in which they are applicable, (2) to present a conceptually digitized application of a multilateral well on a stacked reservoir XXXX in a Niger Delta field using SEPAL software. To achieve the latter goal, after a preliminary and detailed casing design, we applied the SEPAL software to design and digitize the proposed multilateral well schematics for the stacked reservoir. From the analysis, a multilateral level 5 junction was selected to overcome specific problems (e.g., wellbore collapse) due to the unconsolidated sands of the reservoir in the field of interest.

Introduction


A multilateral well is a single well with one or more wellbore branches radiating from the main borehole. It may be an exploration well, an infill development well, or re-entry into an existing well. Multilateral completion systems allow the drilling and completion of multiple lateral boreholes within a single main bore. It describes the assembly and installation of a downhole pipe and related equipment so that oil and gas can be efficiently and safely extracted from various target zones of the reservoir. Multilateral well completions can be carried out in new and existing wells. Between 1980 and 1995, only 45 multilaterals well completions were reported; however, since 1995, hundreds of multilateral wells have been completed. This increased number of multilateral wells is related to a rapid sequence of advances in drilling multilateral wells—directional and horizontal drilling techniques, advanced drilling equipment, and coiled tubing drilling, Bosworth et al., (1998). Well completions for multilateral wells are very different from vertical wells or even single-leg horizontal wells. The critical distinguishing component in a multilateral well completion is the junction construction, which provides communication and conduction between the laterals and the main borehole.


Cooper and Dowell (1988) explained the many circumstances to consider before deciding to drill horizontal wells, and these must also be considered in the final completion design. Some of these circumstances include (1) Thin reservoirs: the productivity index (PI) for a horizontal well reflects the increased area of contact of the well with the reservoir. (2) Vertical permeability: The productivity obtained by drilling a horizontal well partially depends on the magnitude of the vertical permeability and the length of the drain hole. The ratio of vertical permeability to horizontal permeability is high; a horizontal well may produce more cost-effectiveness than a vertical well. (3) Heterogeneous reservoirs: where horizontal drain-hole may provide several advantages when reservoir heterogeneity exists in the horizontal plane. This type of horizontal wellbore in the reservoir provides potential for far more information about the reservoir than would typically be available. As logging and completion techniques become more sophisticated, this aspect of horizontal wells is likely to be very advantageous. Other circumstances include recovery from water flooding and field development plans.


Economides et al. (2001) discussed the three major categories of multilateral well designs, reservoir consideration, and their application. The 3 categories are open-hole multilateral wells, limited-isolation/access multilateral systems, and complete multilateral systems. Garrouch et al. (2004) presented the various lateral completion types that must be designed to fit the production constraints and the reservoir characteristics; for consolidated formations: (a) Open-hole, (b) pre-drilled or slotted-liner. (c) Pre-drilled or slotted liner with external casing packers. (d) Cased, cemented, and perforated, while for unconsolidated formations: (a) Open-hole with pre-drilled liner and stand-alone screen, (b) Open-hole with stand-alone screen, and (c) Open-hole gravel pack.


Safare (2004) noted that multilateral well systems had developed rapidly based on technological advancements in the oil industry since their introduction. In the upstream sector, which involves exploration and production, the aim is to produce hydrocarbons optimally and efficiently. In carrying out this task, the following are some challenges faced:


Difficult reservoir conditions such as tight formations or laminated reservoirs,Complex geologic conditions such as compartmentalized or stacked reservoirs,Efficient and effective reservoir management and development plans.


Multilateral well technology provides innovative solutions to the above areas, and positive results have been obtained regarding production and finances. Figure 1 shows the geometries of multilateral wells ranging from a single drain-hole to multiple well branches in horizontal-fanned, vertical stacked or dual-opposed arrangements. These geometries are determined by the number of targets, depths/pressures, well construction parameters, and risk analysis.

Many issues are involved in completion selection, and design of a multilateral well. The main concerns include borehole stability at the junctions and in the main wellbore and laterals, production/injection control, and re-entry for workover or stimulation. Hill, Zhu & Economides (2008) stated some factors to consider when designing a multilateral well completion. These factors are reservoir structure, junction formation characteristics, the differential pressure at the junction, production and injection management, and re-entry capacity.


In pursuing optimum production, low-cost benefit, and maximum recovery of reserves, multilateral completions can provide a great advantage. The following failures include equipment-use failure, cementing issues of the junction or lateral, excessive drawdown causing junction collapse occurs when well completion is not sufficiently designed or reviewed when well plans changed. Computer-aided design of multilateral well completions helps mitigate these failures. It allows flexibility in selecting, designing, and optimizing appropriate multilateral well-completion design, thereby increasing reliability. Thus, this paper describes the conceptual design and analysis for the optimum multilateral well design using a computer-aided design approach. This approach will guide the effective selection of completion design, optimum casing design, effective equipment design, and easy modification of the multilateral well completion design, if necessary.


Multilateral Well Completion Levels


The Technology Advancement of Multilaterals (TAML) system for multilateral junction classification is based on support and hydraulic integrity provided at the junction. Wells were categorized according to the type of junction used to join the main bore to the lateral and produced standards that were designated TAML Levels 1 through 6. The ascending order of these levels reflects the junction's increasing mechanical and pressure capability. Consequently, cost, complexity, and risk also increase at the higher TAML levels (Flatern, 2016). They are as follows:


Level 1: It's an open-hole lateral drilled from an open-hole mother-bore. There is no mechanical support or hydraulic isolation at the junction. Level 1 completions have been selected for many multilateral wells from the early stage of multilateral well development because of their simplicity and low cost. The requirements are consolidated, highly competent formations because of the lack of junction and lateral support. (Hill et al., 2008). Production control and zonal isolation generally are not available in commingled production. In Level 1 wells, re-entry is also not guaranteed. These disadvantages limit the applications of Level 1 multilateral completion.Level 2: Here, the main borehole is cased and cemented, but the laterals have simple completions such as an open hole, a slotted liner laying in the lateral from the main bore, or a prepacked screen laying in the lateral from the main bore. There are two ways to create the lateral at the junction, either by pre-milled windows or by milling through the casing. Consequently, the complexity is increased. But since the casing supports the junction, it achieves more borehole stability than Level 1 completion. After drilling the lateral, a standard Level 2 completion is to set a sliding sleeve at the junction between two packers and leave the lateral open hole. With the sliding sleeve open, both laterals produce commingled. For zonal isolation in this completion, a plug can be set in the lower packer to shut off the lower lateral for water coning and other production problems. To shut off the upper lateral section by closing the sliding sleeve. Notice that commingled production from both laterals cannot be separated once inside the tubing. Re-entry is also limited in this completion because of the sliding sleeve (Hogg, 1997).Level 3: The main wellbore is cased and cemented, and the lateral is cased but not cemented. The main advantage of Level 3 completion is that the mechanical integrity at the junction is improved compared with Level 2 completions. A Level 3 junction provides sand control means for unconsolidated formations and provides limited junction support for heavy-oil production. Since hydraulic integrity is not available in Level 3 completions without cement at the junction, junction failure is still a problem when pressure drawdown is substantial after a production period.Level 4: The main borehole and the lateral are cased and cemented at the junction for this type. Level 4 provides better mechanical integrity and hydraulic isolation by cementing at the junction compared to Level 3. It can withstand higher-pressure differential and prevent sand problems at the junction. The completion procedure is more complicated because it takes more trips and has more equipment. Level 4 completions can be created either by milling a window in the casing from the main wellbore or by using a pre-milled casing. After the lateral is drilled, a liner is placed and cemented in the lateral.Level 5: These completions were developed based on Level 4 systems with improvements in pressure integrity. The junction's full pressure integrity is achieved by running tubular and packers in the main wellbore and the lateral. In a typical Level 5 completion, there is a dual packer above the junction location and two more packers below the junction in the lower part of both the main wellbore and the lateral. Two tubing strings are run below the dual packer into the main wellbore and the lateral, and the additional packers seal them in the main wellbore and the lateral. Level 5 multilateral offers the best solution for multilateral wells in weak, incompetent environments that are susceptible to wellbore collapse.Level 6: This is the most advanced completion in multilateral well technology. Full pressure integrity and hydraulic isolation at the junction are achieved with casing strings, both in the main wellbore and in the lateral. A Level 6 junction has several significant advantages compared with other multilateral completions. It is a single component completion, the junction completion process is much simpler, and it eliminates the debris from downhole milling or wash-over processes. The resulting completion offers maximum flexibility while minimizing risk and complexity. The current primary limitations of Level 6 junctions are the larger hole size required and the high cost (Hill et al., 2008). It is typically employed at the bottom of a casing string. After the casing and junction are cemented into place, the laterals are drilled and tied back to the junction with some cemented lateral liner and hanger assembly (Sarfare, 2004).

Complete Multilateral Well System


A complete multilateral system provides two to five laterals from one new or existing wellbore. The system must also be compatible with cementing operations for liners, slotted liners, and prepacked screens for sand control.


Applications


The lateral wellbore is cased back to the primary bore exit in this design. The liner casing string is mechanically connected to the primary bore casing; the lateral-to-main-wellbore junction must be hydraulically sealed. Any complete lateral bore or portions of any lateral can be isolated to control the production inflow profile. Each lateral must also be accessible for re-entry without rig intervention.


Reservoir Considerations


Proper reservoir modeling and target selection must occur during the project planning phase, and a stable, non-sloughing, impermeable shale or hard rock formation is desirable at the exit point. However, if the target selection requires exit in unconsolidated sands or in the producing interval itself, the unconsolidated sand can be stabilized with cement or plasticized material. Since low to medium build rates will be used to simplify casing installation, engineers must select targets and plan drill paths with such considerations in mind.


Installation Considerations


The primary bore is drilled, and the primary production casing string is cemented in place across all anticipated lateral-bore exit points. The primary bore is typically drilled into a producing zone and completed for final production.

Advantages of Multilateral Wells


Multilateral wells leverage the existing advantages of horizontal wells with further improvements to produce multilayer pay zones [Oluwadairo, (2018), Rivera, et al., (2003)] compared the economics of levels 3 and 6 multilateral junction configurations to a horizontal well for a natural flow of oil of gravity between 20 – 29° API in a homogeneous reservoir, and permeability ranging from 10 mD to 1250 mD. Results showed that the two-branched multilateral produced 13% more oil than the horizontal well in a high permeability reservoir. The multilateral produced 80% more oil than the horizontal well in a low permeability reservoir with low viscosity oil and 10 to 15% less water than the horizontal well. Horizontal wells have the following benefits over vertical wells: better sweep efficiencies, decreased water, and gas coning tendencies, increased exposure to natural fractures in the formation, and increased efficiency of draining relatively thin formation layers, ultimately leading to higher productivity indices from the well. In summary, multilateral provide the following advantages:


Greater contact area to reservoir ratio and increased exposure to natural fracture systems via multiple laterals.Low cost-benefit ratio: reduced capital spent on drilling the well, wellhead installation, platform risers, and completion equipment compared to multiple wells. An operator in the Arabian Gulf reported 35% savings per well, despite 44% extra cost compared to a single horizontal (Al-Umair, 2000).Access to multiple pay zones, including thin layers or older and formerly depleted reservoirs from a single location.Well slot optimization and minimized environmental impact or footprint in offshore and harsh or remote locations.Extend the life of an existing field development by drilling laterals out of the existing wellbores and tapping into reserves that were not recovered during the earlier production stage.Accelerated production, i.e., higher flow rates at lower pressure drops than single-bore wells.


Methodology


This section includes the procedures involved in this study, including the theoretical assumptions. The usage of SEPAL (Structured Engineering Presentation and Analytics Leverage) in this study comprises the design, digitization, and management of well schematics on a single platform. This SEPAL module is used to generate conceptual well-completion schematics (initial), store completion schematic as deployed (final), and manage changes to well configurations because of intervention over time. All these data can be queried and retrieved from the database when required. The SEPAL Well Schematic Management module output is a digital well status diagram that can be queried for various engineering analyses and easily updated to capture the evolution of schematics over the life of the well.

Preliminary Analysis


Determination of the Casing Setting Depth


The principle of selecting the casing shoe setting depths starts with the knowledge of pore pressure, fracture gradient, and mud density. These can be obtained using the following equations:

Detailed Design


The detailed design includes the determination of casing specifications: the grades, the connection type, and the weight of each casing string. The selection process compares the pipe ratings with the design loads such as bursts and collapse and applies minimum acceptable safety standards (i.e., design factors). The API design factors are essential "safety factors" to design safe, reliable casing strings. The following will be used in this study:

Surface Controlled Subsurface Safety Valve (SCSSV)


The SCSSV acts as a fail-safe to isolate the wellbore in case of mechanical system failure or damage to the surface production-control facilities. The control system operates with hydraulic control pressure used to hold open a ball or flapper assembly that will close if the control pressure is lost.


Gas-lift Mandrel


The gas-lift mandrel is assembled with the production tubing string to provide a means of locating gas-lift valves. At a later time, when the well cannot produce naturally because of a reduction in pressure, the gas-lift system will become necessary


Packer


The packers in the producing zones act as a sealing device that isolates and contains produced fluids and pressures within the tubing string. The dual-access and the single-access packer in the vertical section of the well support some of the tubing weight and prevent downhole movement of the tubing strings.


Intervention Discriminator


This tool helps access the laterals 2 and 3 selectively; also, the production from each lateral is commingled through the 3½ inch.


Inflow Control Valve


The presence of surface-controlled, variable inflow control valves to control the commingled production from laterals 2 and 3 and prevent crossflow. This device provides an overall capability to effectively manage the reservoir and production over the life of the well, which prolongs the field life, thus improving overall economic performance and field economics.


Autonomous Inflow Control Device (AICD)


The AICD in the lateral zones can help balance hydrocarbon flow as it enters the production string. The significant function here is to delay gas and water influx and reduce gas and water influx on breakthrough


Downhole Flowmeter


The downhole flow meter enables a less intrusive flow monitoring of the producing zones. It may be equipped with at least a sensor designed to sense a parameter (e.g., pressure and temperature) related to fluid flow.


Frac-Pack


Due to the unconsolidated sands of the Reservoir XXXX, a frac-pack sand control method is used to improve the productivity of the producing zones over the life of the well. Frac-packing merges two distinct processes—hydraulic fracturing and gravel packing.


Conclusion


The optimum multilateral well completion proposed in this work satisfies the conceptual design requirements. These requirements include the casing preliminary and detailed designs and selecting the appropriate equipment needed to ensure efficient operation of the well. Hence, taking a digital approach in designing multilateral wells provides solutions to the problems earlier stated. The schematics obtained is a crucial parameter during the planning phase of constructing the well and can be followed through to the completion of the well, production, and re-entry operations. The Level 5 lateral junction type is selected for this well completion design to overcome wellbore collapse due to the unconsolidated sands of the reservoir.
