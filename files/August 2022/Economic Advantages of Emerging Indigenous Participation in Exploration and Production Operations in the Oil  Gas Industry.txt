Abstract


The study is a combination of survey and exploratory design. It utilized primary data (questionnaire) and secondary data (as journal, articles, industry reports and newspapers) with relative contents to the topic of discuss. The questionnaire was distributed to E&P workers in three LOCs, SEPLAT, Famfa oil and Yinka Folawiyo Petroleum. IOCs respondents from Shell, Total and Exon Mobil. Ten 10 questionnaires were distributed to each making 60 and 51 questionnaires retrieved and completed. The data gathered was presented using tables and analyzed using simple percentages, frequency and mean. The study concluded that participation of indigenous companies in exploration and production activities in the country has several economic advantages which both individuals and the government can benefit from. This includes increased production (barrels), increased Gross Domestic Product of the nation, job creation/ reduction of unemployment in the country and improved human resources due to training of indigenous worker. It recommended that the local content policy of 2010 should be taken more seriously by the government and more indigenous companies should be encouraged to go into oil exploration and production to increase the availability of crude oil products in the market which will automatically lead to better GDP, reduction in capital flight and increase in individual company income.

Introduction


Around 90% (90%) of Nigeria's annual federal government revenue is derived from the crude oil and natural gas (CONG) business, but only 38% of the country's GDP is generated by this sector (GDP). While exploration and production have traditionally been viewed as a "reserve economy," they have really had little impact on the rest of society. In the first three months of 2015, the oil industry accounted for 74.4 percent of Nigeria's exports and generated 14.2 billion dollars in income, according to the Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics (2015b). More than three-quarters of the country's gross domestic product is generated by this source of revenue (GDP). There has been little impact on the country's economy despite the country's abundant oil resources due to the fact that foreign oil firms handle a large amount of the sector's activity (Ihua, et al., 2013). Petroleum exploration and production in Brazil, Indonesia, Norway, and Venezuela is optimised by utilising local resources and capabilities to their full potential. Because they began oil exploration and production later than Nigeria, these countries’ attempts to develop local content in this critical industry have been tremendously successful, a task that Nigeria faces after more than four decades of oil exploration and production. Nigeria remains highly ranked in terms of poverty and technological backwardness in the world in spite of her growing profile and wealth as one of the highly gifted oilfield country. This is ultimately owing to the wealth not yet transforming to better welfare (Atakpu, 2013). One reason for this is that in excess of 90% of the annual Exploration and Production industry outflows escape the national economy as capital flight. The emergence of indigenous oil industry owing to the enacted 2010 Local content policy has since seen a change in the order of things, with the vast majority of the population now enjoying the economic benefit of the oil resource (Bello, 2010). In context, Indigenous E & P industry is an industry which is registered in Nigeria with Nigerians holding 60 to 100% of the shares, and possessing appropriate expertise, couple with financial sustainability, and ability to operate, it has shown to be a significant contributor to economic growth. Since 2010, the sector has generated at least 30,000 direct and indirect jobs in Nigeria (Ebiri, 2012). Numerous indigenous exploration and production companies, such as Seplat, have significantly influenced the development of indigenous content on their properties. Adeola's given name is Adeola (2018). Currently, over 80% of senior management positions in the company are held by Nigerians, while 99 percent of the company's overall staff is made up of Nigerians. In compliance with the provisions of the NOGICD Act, 98 percent of Seplat's subcontractors are Nigerian firms (Adepetun, 2010). In the previous three years alone, Nigerian enterprises have received contracts totalling $1 billion. Indigenous Participation makes worthy Business Intelligence – the use of highly trained Human Resources will eventually lead to lesser operating costs and hence enhanced cost-effectiveness for the E & P industry's assets. Industries’ bottom line will without doubt become better in the long run and are also able to engender the trust and good will in their areas of operations, what also transforms to long term value-added profitability. Coker (2008), Nigeria aspiration is to set apart a considerable sum of the average Eighteen (18) billion dollars’ yearly exploration and production (E&P) expenditure and halt the flow of capital flight that has rendered her an inferior partner in her joint venture arrangements with international oil companies over the centuries (IOCs). If this aspiration is to be attained, indigenous participation must further be strengthened by the arms of the local content policy.


The study targets to inspect the benefits of the emerging indigenous Exploration and production industries on Nigeria economy.


Background of study


Conceptual framework


The development of local content laws has given way for indigenous oil and gas exploration and production companies to emerge. Without the implementation of the Local Content Act, companies like SEPLAT, Savannah Energy Plc., Network Exploration & Production, Frontier Oil, Aieteo Eastern Exploration & Production would not be in existence today.


Olorunshola, (2010) views local content as any organisation having a non-temporal functioning administrative centre in a specific geographical region. It has been defined based on the worth it gives to the country's’ economy by patronising locally produced goods and services. "Local value-added" is the fortune indigenous organisations accrue as a result of transforming raw materials to completed goods and generating revenue from internal services rendered (Esho, 2006). In computing it, the formula is derived as ‘the organisations production worth take away every product or service not purchased within the country (comprised of raw materials, energy, contractor services, and rents). According to the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA), local content is defined as the additional benefit brought to a host country (or area or locality) through the development of indigenous employees in various industries and the funding of supplier development (improving and purchasing indigenous materials and facilities).


Indigenous oil exploration companies are upstream organisation springing up within the nation and utilising indigenous employees and resources to enable exploration and production of oil (Akinpelu, Omole, and Falode, 2010). Indigenous oil exploration and production companies are owned completely by Nigerians / the Nigerian state.


Emerging Indigenous Oil Exploration Companies


Emerging indigenous oil companies are those who are (i) recorded to have 60-100% shareholding in Nigeria (ii) have adequate knowledge and funding abilities and (iii) been able to add to the growth of the nation where it is situated (Nwasike, 2002). Nevertheless, selected individuals views, indigenous E&P companies as the ‘the opposite of international oil companies like Shell, Chevron, Mobil, Addax Petroleum, Conoco Energy and so forth’ (Tilije, 2002). Disparate international oil companies, local suppliers of emerging indigenous oil E & P companies regrettably currently do not have a high equity-base, which is usually controlled by its owner and do not have the ability of meeting the huge monetary burden which it involves.


Aneke (2012) never the less in his opinion suggested that small and medium organisations embrace the benefits which the privilege in E&P industry provides thus increasing the value added to the county through local content policies.


Benefits of Emerging Oil Exploration and Production Companies to the Nigerian Economy


Indigenous local entrepreneurs’ participation in important monetary and production-related activities such as exploration and mining benefits to a nation's advancement and helps sustain its economy (Nwosu, et. al., 2006).


The oil and gas industry significantly contributes to the nation's economy, accounting for more than 90% of foreign exchange earnings from the sale of crude oil. Continuous involvement and contribution activities of rising indigenous E&P enterprises can help increase the local economy by creating jobs, improving social amenities, and raising the standard of living (Nwosu, et.al.2006). This breakthrough significantly reduces capital flight; instead of paying expatriates, supporting training and development programmes outside Nigeria, purchasing equipment from other countries, and importing software and data-monitoring systems used by the business (Agusto, 2009). Indigenous Participation is a wise business strategy –utilizing resources grown and produced locally especially well trained human resources will enhance lesser purchase and running cost thus increasing the profit made. The main point is that firms will unarguably get better in the long run. Services rendered by organizations can be tested and trusted leading to increased income (Akinpelu and Falode, 2010).


Challenges Faced by Indigenous E&P Companies


There is a notion in Nigeria that financing E&P by local companies involves very large capital and high technology which discourages indigenous contractors from delving into the industry (Nwosu, et al, 2006). According to the majority of major international oil firms, ‘indigenous companies (and individuals) do poorly’ (Tilije, 2002). This low performance rate leads to (i) lesser opportunities presented to indigenous entrepreneurs (ii) Multinationals get more contracts and this increases their earnings which flows out of Nigeria (iii) Lack of job opportunities’ for citizens because the process has been seen to be insincere, non-transparent and compromise on the part of major stakeholders of the industry.


Regardless of the large employment of local workers by indigenous companies, they face several challenges such as agitation by the youths, conflicts, disruptions, kidnapping, and stealing of tools used for work. This can however not be compared to the level of up heal experienced by multinationals from indigenes of the region (Nwasike, 2002). The above mentioned disadvantages brings about delay in implementation of planned industrial activities especially in the Niger Delta. This is often caused by inequity in distribution of national resources, environmental degradation and oil pollution. The emergence of indigenous E&P companies is also challenged by lack of a stimulating governmental supervisory structure, insufficient monetary records, especially audited accounts, dishonesty and maladministration or hazy accountability, constantly changing unstable political and economic environments in Nigeria.


Through education and training, indigenous E&P enterprises may be better managed and updated; local content in the E&P industry would benefit the Nigerian economy significantly. It would be an excellent technique of empowering local contractors and might serve as a motivating factor for the industry's necessary advancements (Nwasike, 2002). According to (Nwosu, et al, 2006), emerging indigenous E&P companies can overcome the challenge of capital by:


Consortium financing: a group of financial institutions led by an agent bank that comes together to provide the required funding. Term loan: a single loan for a specified length of time or a series of loans at specified dates.Credit line: a one-year loan that must be repaid or renewed.Advances: Loans of up to 90 days with a maximum term of 90 days.Overdrafts: cheques on funds that don't exist are honoured by banks in this situation.Invoice discounting: nonrecourse sale of receivables to a financial institution.Equipment leasing: the proprietor of a particular equipment enters an agreement with the lesee in a bid to overcome the monetary burden of associated with purchasing capital intensive equipment's used in the oil industry.


Overview of Nigeria's exploration and production activity


In order to boost the value-added, it appears that all stakeholders are paying attention to the necessity for resource-rich Nigeria to take control of oil and gas exploration, exploitation, and production activities and to harness the potential of this most tactical industry. The inability of Nigeria to utilise the materials wealth at her disposal to advance the nation and eradicate poverty has been a major issue facing administrations regardless the 37 billion barrels in her reserve and more than forty years in the oil and gas exploration and production industry (Balouga, 2012).


Since 1960, wealth derived from oil production has aided economic growth in Nigeria. In 1970, total oil export revenue was $718 million. When crude oil was sold at roughly US $90 a barrel in 2012, revenues climbed from US$47.9 billion in 2005 to US$94.6 billion in 2012. (OPEC, 2013). Despite this, the country's oil reserves have had little impact on the general well-being of its citizens because a large number of industrial events, primarily service contracts, are handled by foreign oil companies (Ihua et al., 2011).


It's widely held that the oil industry's capital and technology-intensive activities, particularly those of the newest oil-producing nations, are detrimental to their economies (Ovadia, 2013; Heum et al., 2003). A UNCTAD report (2010) stated that employment can be generated by the oil sector by permitting participation of more indigenous companies. According to the report thee economy can be transformed as a result. In a bid to solve the problem, LC policy was put in place in 2001 and 10 years later, passed into law. It is structured in a manner that improves the abilities of indigenous companies and giving them more leverage to partake in oil and gas transactions. The federal government of Nigeria aimed to introduce 45% local content in 2007 and in 2010 raise it to 70% (Ihua et. al., 2011). Forward and backward connections are anticipated to be created by the policy in the area of purchase and use of input materials made within the country which ensures that jobs are made available (Esteves et al., 2013; Ihua et al, 2011). The government yearly funding in the oil industry has risen from US$8billion to about US$20billion simply by making activities oil and gas trading bigger to accommodate local companies (Ovadia, 2013; INTSOK, 2012, Ihua et. al., 2011). Intense involvement of the indigenous people and firms is needed to ensure investment in local companies continues over a long period of time. When policies as this is not put in place, privileges for investing is often capitalised majorly by foreign firms. The present amount of local companies’ investment in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria is 18 billion every year. This trend in investment will be in practice even after 2012. This is a proof that the creation of the support fund for local content came at the right time. Capital need to work by indigenous companies, a free industry to operate and financing that helps reduce production cost are all contained in the LC policy.


Materials and method


The paper is a mix of survey and exploratory study in terms of design. The study utilized both primary and secondary data. The study also utilized qualitative secondary data such as journal, articles, industry reports e.t.c. which have relative contents to the topic of discuss. The questionnaire was distributed to E&P workers in three LOCs, SEPLAT, Famfa oil and Yinka Folawiyo Petroleum. IOCs respondents from Shell, Total and Exon Mobile. Ten 10 questionnaires were distributed to each making 60 and 51 questionnaire retrieved and completed. Data were analysed using simple percentages, frequency and mean. Table were used to present the data gathered.


Results and discussion


Data from table 1 shows four (4) selected emerging Indigenous Exploration and Production (E&P) companies and the crude oil produced in barrel per day (bpd). It shows that Seplat Petroleum Development Company PLC contributes 47,163 barrels per day of oil to the Nigerian economy, with Famfa oil, Frontier oil limited and Yinka Folawiyo Petroleum producing 1601.6bpd, 1000bpd and 70,000bpd respectively.

As seen from the mean scores in the table 2 above, both upstream and downstream workers are of the opinion that the enactment of Local content policy has greatly impacted on the Nigerian Economy as ‘more grounds are given to the indigenous Exploration and Production companies to operate’, ‘Job creation for the indigenes of Nigeria’, as well as ‘increased opportunity for indigenous E & P’. The table as well shows that more grounds are given to the indigenous Exploration and Production companies to operate’ had the highest mean set of 3.070, with ‘increased opportunity for indigenous E & P’ coming second with a mean set of 3.020, meanwhile, ‘Job creation for the indigenes of Nigeria’ is perceived to next impact of implementing the Local content policy in the upstream (Exploration and production) and downstream. Both upstream and downstream workers had low perception of the policy greatly impacting on ‘Reducing more than half of the country's unemployment problems’ and ‘also stimulated knowledge and technology transfers as well as capacity building’ as both had the lowest mean set that far below the Criterion, they both have mean set 2.040 and 2.090 respectively. As seen in the table 2, ‘Increased opportunities to indigenous E & P’ and ‘Reduced more than half of the country's unemployment problems’ mean are higher at the upstream as compared to the downstream, while the downstream had superior mean in comparison to upstream worker's perception in the following variables: ‘more grounds are given to the indigenous Exploration and Production companies to operate’, ‘Job creation for the indigenes of Nigeria’ and ‘Reducing unemployment by more than half, as well as stimulating the transfer of knowledge and technological capacity building.

The general outcome from table 2 tells us that unemployment problems in the country has not been reduced by more than half, and also not enough stimulated knowledge and technology transfers and capacity building has been observed. Although it was observed that there are more than enough opportunities for indigenes to be key players in the E&P phase of the oilfields. While unemployment has not been cut to half in the country, ample jobs have been created for the indigenes to tap into.


Table 3 shows the socio-demographic data of the selected International and indigenous oil companies for the survey on the economic advantages of indigenous participation in the Exploration and Production (E&P) industry. From the table 3, 88.2% of the respondents were male, with 11.8% of the respondents being female. The Age range with the highest distribution of respondents was (35-44) years having 39.2% of the total respondents, whereas age range (45-54) years have the lowest percentage of the respondents with only 15.7%. The survey sees 52.9% of the respondents being indigenous oil industry workers, while just 47.1% of the respondents being international oil industry workers. With regards to years of experience at their current companies, 62.7% representing the highest percent of the respondents have had (6-11) years of work experience at their current industry, and only 7.9% of the respondents have had above 17years of experience.

Table 4 shows the results of survey conducted on the impact of participation of emerging indigenous Exploration and Production (E&P) companies on Nigerian economy. On if ‘local content policy has positively affected indigenous E&P industry’, highest percentage of the respondents (45.0%) strongly agree with just 9.9% of the respondents strongly disagree. 33.3% and 31.4% of the respondents strongly agree and agree respectively to ‘number of barrels produced in the country increasing as a result of participation of indigenous E&P Companies’, while only 13.7% strongly disagree. Most of the respondents (39.1%) ‘Strongly agree’ that ‘various opportunities have been created as a result of indigenous E&P participation in the industry’, while 9.9% disagree. Highest member of the E&P workers (50.9%) recruited for this survey ‘strongly agree’ that ‘Nigerian Gross Domestic Profit (GDP) has experienced a rise as a result of indigenous participation in oil and gas E&P industry’, meanwhile, 3.2% ‘disagree’. The highest percentage of respondents (47.1%) ‘Strongly disagree’ that ‘Production cost has drastically reduced due to the employment of local contractors in E&P’ with 3.2% respondents representing lowest percentage ‘strongly agree’. Majority of the respondents representing 52.9% ‘strongly agree’ that ‘more jobs have been created and the human resource of the country has been improved upon due to training of indigenous workers’, while 1.9% of the respondents ‘strongly disagree’.

Discussion Of Results


On the basis of the survey, it appears that the implementation of the 2010 local content policy has had a favourable impact on indigenous participation in the economy. Exploration and Production (E&P) industry that was greatly dominated by the international oil companies. There is increase in production of oil (barrel per day) owing to the emergence of indigenous companies participating in the Exploration and Production (E&P); from the table 1, we can see that only four (4) out of the emerging indigenous E&P companies contributes 119764.6bpd of crude oil on daily basis, confirming this part of findings from the survey. OPEC (2020), recent report from OPEC indicates that by 2021 there will be an increase in demand of crude oil, with this in mind it is very imperative that more indigenous company emerge to rise the production of oil in Nigeria. Numerous opportunities have been created as a result of indigenous E&P participation in the industry; this goes in tandem with findings from table 2. Due to indigenous participation in the E&P business, GDP has increased. This is a good sign that local content policy is working, and it could be because rising indigenous industries are regulating capital flight flow. However, despite all of the aforementioned beneficial impacts, the survey results suggest that there has been no significant reduction in the cost of crude oil production despite the use of local contractors for exploration. Lastly, job opportunities have been created for the indigenes due to the emergence of the indigenous companies, statistics from Seplat Petroleum Development Company PLC showed that more than 30,000 jobs were created with 99% of those job going to the indigenes; reducing unemployment which is one of Nigeria major problems.


Conclusion and Recommendations


From the examination conducted above and the result that has been shown, we therefore conclude that participation of indigenous companies in exploration and production activities in the country has several economic advantages which both individuals and the government can benefit from. This includes increased production (barrels), increased Gross Domestic Product of the nation, job creation/ reduction of unemployment in the country and improved human resources due to training of indigenous workers.


The study further recommends the following:


The local content policy of 2010 should be taken more seriously by the government and more indigenous companies should be encouraged to go into oil exploration and production to increase the availability of crude oil products in the market which will automatically lead to better GDP, reduction in capital flight and increase in individual company income.The government should make and implement friendlier policies that will help emerging indigenous companies thrive in the face of competition with International Oil Companies.The quality of products produced by emerging indigenous E&P companies must be checkmated and standardized to ensure that it meets the same quality produced by IOCs, this will ensure the safety of consumers and also increase consumers trust in the product being purchased thereby motivating them to purchase more from indigenous companies. This in the long run leads to increased profit.
