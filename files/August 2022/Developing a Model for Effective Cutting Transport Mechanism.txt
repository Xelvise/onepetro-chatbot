Abstract


The transportation of cuttings and wellbore stability are indispensable in any drilling program. This is because a successful drilling operation is the key to a profitable business in the oil and gas sector, efficiency of cuttings transport is very important for a good drilling program, the transportation of these cuttings through the annulus is a complex problem that is affected by many parameters.The objective is to design drilling mud for efficient cutting transport in different holes sections and develop a model that is more effective in lifting cuttings through the annulus without affecting the stability of the wellbore.Cutting transport efficiency in vertical and deviated wellbore has been reported to depend on the following factors; hole geometry and inclination, average fluid velocity, flow regime, drill pipe rotation, pipe eccentricity, fluid properties and rheology, cuttings size and shape, cuttings transport velocity, slip velocity, etc., the accumulation of drilling cuttings in the wellbore causes several drilling problems. These includes an increase in torque and drag, which may limit drilling from reaching to a desired target formation, the analysis is carried-out using different cutting transport models like; larsians model, rubiandini's model, moore's model, Hopkins method and zeidler's slip velocity correlation.This paper work is aimed at achieving a cutting transport model (I,e developing a model), that is more effective in lifting the drilled cuttings from the wellbore through the annulus to the surface after considering different existing cutting transport models and it is required that parameters affecting the efficient cutting transport are considered simultaneously.

Introduction


Transportation of cuttings is a mechanism that is a vital factor for a good drilling program. In directional and horizontal drilling, hole cleaning is a common and costly problem. Ineffective removal of cuttings can result in several problems, such as bit wear, slow drilling rate, increased ECD (which can lead to formation fracturing), high torque, drag, and in the worst case, the drill pipe can be stuck. If this type of situation is not handled properly, the problem can escalate to side tracking or loss of well, at worst.


Cuttings transport is controlled by many variables such as well inclination angle, hole and drill-pipe diameter, rotation speed of drill pipe (RPM), drill-pipe eccentricity, rate of penetration (ROP), cuttings characteristics like cuttings size and porosity of bed and drilling fluids characteristics like flow rate, fluid velocity, flow regime, mud type and non - Newtonian mud rheology. The key factors for optimizing hole cleaning is a result of good well planning, good drilling fluid properties, and good drilling experience.


Methodology


The research design chosen for this research work is the descriptive approach. In this descriptive research, coherent inferences will be drawn from series of available data.


The data generated will be presented in a tabular form by the researcher and also with the aid of Microsoft Excel. The researcher intends to use a simple comparative analysis to represent the answers to the research questions. In this regard, the different formation configurations, different mud system, and potential damage that can happen during the course of using any of these mud systems will be taken into consideration in selecting the most effective and efficient drilling fluid for cutting transport mechanism.


The data was further analyzed comparatively using Microsoft Excel. Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet-based software tool that employs formulae and functions to arrange numbers and data. Excel analysis is used by businesses of all sizes all around the world to undertake various analysis. In this regard, the wellbore damage due to drilling will be quantified based on cutting transport parameters. The effects of these parameters on the different cutting transport models and the best model to be used in HTHP wells in niger delta.

Discussion


In general the hole-cleaning becomes worse as well inclination increases from vertical to horizontal. Increasing flow rates can improve the cuttings-transport performance. As hole- inclination increases from vertical to horizontal, if appropriate flow rate is not used a cuttings-bed development will occur. Especially at inclinations between 40 and 60°, hole- cleaning is most difficult because of back sliding of the cuttings inside the wellbore. for any well inclination and under all operational conditions the higher the flow rate clean the well effectively.


Conclusion


The results show that the impact of parameters depends on various combinations parameters.


Increasing viscosity, density of fluid requires an increase flow rateIncreasing ROP requires an increase flow rateIncreasing well size requires an increase flow rateIncreasing cutting density requires an increase flow rateIncreasing cutting size requires an increase flow rateIncreasing RPM reduces the flow rate requiredIncreasing mud weight reduces the flow rate required
