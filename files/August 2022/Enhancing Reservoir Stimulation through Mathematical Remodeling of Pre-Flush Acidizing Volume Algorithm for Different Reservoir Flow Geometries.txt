Abstract


Studies show that an average of 35% of reservoir acid stimulation operations executed every year fails because of limited knowledge of downhole acid placement. Existing models designed for acid pre-flush volumes are limited to Linear, Radial and Ellipsoidal reservoir geometries, therefore, do not account for geological drifts of a typical heterogenic reservoir. This can be erroneous while estimating acid placement volumes as reservoirs can deviate from defined flow geometries due to their dynamic and heterogeneous nature, thereby challenging to estimate acid volumes precisely for stimulations. This study aims to foster sustainability in reservoir flow engineering by deriving a mathematical model that evaluates volumes for reservoirs with flow geometries that deviate from linear and radial. This was established to help introduce a new geometry contributing to the accountability of complex and heterogeneous reservoirs. Sensitivity analysis and investigation using reservoir core data from SPDC Petroleum Chemistry Laboratory were carried out to understand the relationship between Linear, Radial and Modified flow geometries. Analytical results for linear, radial and the fied were generated. These results proved the precision of the modified equation for calculating pre-flush acid volume for reservoir acid stimulation operation.

Introduction


Any unintended impedance to the flow of fluids into or out of a wellbore is referred to as Formation Damage (Mukul, 2007). These damages cause skin production (Amanat, 2004 & Egu, 2014). Well stimulation is a technique used to improve fluid flow from the reservoir and enhance well productivity by dissolving the rock or creating new channels around the wellbore (Schechter, 1992; Schlumberger, 2000 & Crowe et al., 1992).


The most applied stimulation techniques are.


❖Matrix treatment (Acidizing):❖Hydraulic fracturing (Halliburton, 2000).


In carrying out Matrix Treatment Stimulation process, HF acid mixture is used to clear the wellbore of skins. Smith and Hendrickson (1965) illustrated the reactive nature of HF acid with silica which makes it exceptional in the application of sandstone acidizing. Hydrochloric, sulfuric, and nitric acids do not react effectively to the sandstone formation, thereby causing precipitates. Interestingly, this can further cause reduced permeability (Gomez, 2006 & Mohammed et al., 2020). Dowell Division of Dow Chemical discovered that sandstone formation particles such as sand grains, feldspar and clays react with HF acid which results to precipitate production that poses as wellbore damages (USOSTI, 1965 & Frenier and Hill, 2002). To this effect, the need to prepare the wellbore with precipitate-control mixtures known as Pre- flush Acids is important to avoid further damage during acid stimulation. Pre-flush containing approximately 15%wt of HCL acid is usually injected into a well before the HF/HCL mixture is injected for sandstone acidizing treatment (Abdelmoneim and Nasr-El-Din, 2015). This is used to prevent the reaction of hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) with formation (Al-Harthy, 2008). The stages of safe acid placement for matrix acid stimulation are Pre-flush, Main Acid, and Post-Flush (Gomaa et al., 2015). In placing pre- flush acids, the knowledge of the reservoir geometry is usually needed in calculating the volume of acid to be injected the and injection rate (Boyun, et al., 2007 & Egu and Ilozobhie, 2021). Existing volume calculation assumes linear, radial, and ellipsoidal reservoir geometries. Investigations prove that reservoir geometry varies because of geological deformations that change the geo-orientation of a reservoir (Hussein, 2016 & Ilozobhie and Egu, 2020). To this effect, the available calculation models designed based on assumptions that the reservoir flow geometry is either linear, radial or ellipsoidal can increase errors in estimating pre-flush volume and injection rates. A new model for linear-Radial flow geometry is developed in this paper for the estimation of pre-flush volume and flow rate for reservoirs with linear- Radial (Modified) flow geometry. This will reduce errors in volume estimation.


This study aims to design and comparatively evaluate the volumes of pre-flush acids for acid stimulation and develop a model for a reservoir with flow geometry that deviates from linear or radial flow profile assuming a liner-radial flow geometry (modified flow geometry).


To achieve this aim, the following objectives are considered.


To design a suitable and convenient mathematical algorithm for linear-radial flow deviation geometry of a typical Niger-delta reservoir.To carry out sensitivity analysis and investigate comparatively the relationship between linear, radial, and Modified flow geometries.

The modified flow equation has been developed and was compared to other existing flow geometries of linear and radial nature. Related parameters in each of the flow geometries were used to make these comparisons.


Comparing Related Parameters in All Flow Geometries


A plot as shown in Figure 29 generated from Table 7 showed an obvious deviation in the linear flow from that of radial and modified flows. In Petroleum Engineering, acid volume estimation considers radial flow geometry because of the heterogeneity of the reservoir making the flow in the reservoir almost impossible to flow in a direction as in the case of the linear flow. Figure 29 indicates a high level of accuracy in the modified flow consideration as it coincides with the radial flow geometry.

Comparing Related Parameters in Linear and Modified Flows


Even though the related parameters in linear and modified flow geometries are more than that of radial and modified flow as indicated in Table 8, the degree of difference between the linear from the modified is high as shown in Figure 30 and Table 8. This indicates the level of heterogeneity of the modified flow geometry which is more valued in the estimation of acid volume.

Comparing Related Parameters in Radial and Modified Flows


The plot in Figure 31 generated from Table 9 shows a coincidental degree of the radial and modified flow geometries despite the few numbers of related parameters in the two flow geometries. This indicates that the modified flow geometry adds value to the estimation of acid volume.

Comprehensive Analytical Results for Linear, Radial and Modified


From Figure 32, it was observed that acid volume for linear flow geometry has a high standard error of mean deviation as high as 1.30206E+14 and the predicted acid volume assuming a modified flow geometry has a lower error of 4000.9 which was overlapping with the radial flow assumption indicating a high degree of similarity.Standard deviation from the mean value of the acid volume assuming linear flow geometry gave a high value of 3.65279E+14, a lower value of 12650.7 for the predicted acid volume and a lower level of 2282.9.The variance degree of acid volume for linear flow was indicated to be 1.36E+12; Radial and modified had a lower value of 5211792 and 160039156 respectively. The results, therefore, prove the degree of confidence and accuracy of the radial and modified flow acid volume.

Conclusion


In conclusion, the modified model for acid volume estimation for acid stimulation jobs should be regarded as a sophisticated acid volume estimation tool as it will be able to account for combined flow geometries at once. The study clearly states that more than 35% of acid stimulation jobs executed every year fail due to limited knowledge of downhole acid placement and flow geometry. The oil and gas industry today estimates acid volume for stimulation jobs considering majorly two types of flow geometries: the linear and radial flow geometries. Study shows that this can lead to erroneous acid volume estimation and unsuccessful acid placement operation due to the heterogeneity of the reservoir. A mathematical model is generated assuming Linear-Radial flow geometry (Modified flow geometry) and it accounts for reservoir flow geometry deviation along a linear to radial profile.


Deriving equations for modified flow geometry showed more related parameters with the linear flow geometry compared to that of the radial flow geometry, but the degree of coincidence was very low. However, the modified flow geometry acid volume was coincidental with the radial flow geometry acid volume; this proves the degree of accuracy of the modified flow geometry.


The study can therefore conclude that modified flow geometry can be assumed for acid stimulation acid volume estimation for linear flow geometry since they have lots of similar parameters and for radial flow geometry since both acid volume results are coincidental.
