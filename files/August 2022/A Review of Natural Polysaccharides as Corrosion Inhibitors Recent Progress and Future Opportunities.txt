Abstract


Preventing and mitigating corrosion problems can be very challenging due to technical considerations and prohibitive economic implications. It is thus imperative to arrest the escalating corrosion rates and impede the deterioration effects of corrosion with versatile remedies. In this review, previous research efforts on the application of plant-derived polysaccharides as potential inhibitors of metal corrosion in various aggressive media are studied. The deployment of corrosion inhibitors has proven to be an outstanding solution to prolonging the lifespan of metals. However, the most applied inhibitors such as the inorganic and some organic compounds are prohibitively expensive, hazardous, and toxic. These limiting factors have stimulated interest in more research into greener and less toxic natural alternatives. Considering the success of synthetic polymers for corrosion inhibition, a wide range of plants with high natural polysaccharide content have been evaluated to determine their effectiveness as biodegradable, renewable, and more economical corrosion inhibitors. Studies generally show that natural polysaccharides exhibit over 90% efficiency for corrosion inhibition with appreciable adsorption on the metal surface. Modification and grafting of the plant polysaccharides to enhance their inhibition efficiencies and to make them more desirable are currently being investigated. Such bio-inspired polymeric molecules thus have invaluable significance as potential alternatives for the problematic corrosion inhibitors.

Introduction


The phenomenon of metal corrosion is still a prevalent hazard in a plethora of industries. Without exception, the oil and gas industry regularly deals with endless costly corrosion problems because it consumes a tremendous amount of tubings and pipes during production, transportation, and storage. Corrosion in simple terms is the deterioration of the metal exposed to an aggressive agent. Technically, it can howbeit be explained as a ruinous aftereffect of an electrochemical redox reaction between the material of the exposed metal and the aggressive agent that may cause its deterioration (Goni & Mazumder, 2019). In oil production, the material of the corrosion-prone downhole and surface metallic tubulars, valves, and tools, becomes even more susceptive to oxidation reactions during acidizing stimulation, pickling, and cleanup activities (Ali & Suleiman, 2018; Govindasamy & Ayappan, 2015). Iron, steels, aluminium, zinc, and copper are some of the commonly used metals/ alloys that are susceptible to corrosive debacles. Such metal loss may be explicitly classified as general, galvanic, localized, erosion, pitting, crevice, microbially-influenced, or stress cracking corrosion (Fontana & Greene, 2018).


According to Javaherdashti (2000), over 96 tons of steel react every day to form rust yet approximately 50% of every ton of the globally produced steel is purposed to replace tainted metal. The impact of corrosion on equipment and its circumambient environment is apparent and deserves a massive amount of attention. Eradicating corrosion is not an uphill task. Similarly, arresting its escalating effects has never been a walk in the park. Corrosion mitigation using contemporary and pragmatic remedies should therefore be an indispensable aspect, deliberately and comprehensively planned for in the current undying industrial society (Ropital, 2009; Verma et al., 2021). The possible corrosion costs, by and large, incurred to deal with corrosion are summarized in Fig.1 below.

For the past couple of years, the approach to corrosion has involved using methods like corrosion-resistant alloys, coatings, dehydration or pigging, pH stabilization, O2/H2S scavengers, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, and drag reduction. However, corrosion inhibitors (CIs) have been deemed more pragmatic, efficient, and economical in industrial facilities when it comes to maintaining pipeline integrity (Kelland, 2014; Saji & Umoren, 2020).


Corrosion inhibitors


Corrosion inhibitors are substances that when added to an aggressive solution in relatively minute concentrations can decelerate or deter any corrosion activity by generating a protective film that insulates the metal (Alrefaee et al., 2020). Oodles of considerations are tabled when selecting an inhibitor. These factors may encompass price tag, availability, reliability, concentration, but most importantly safety (Ayoola et al., 2020; Heidarshenas et al., 2020). Ideally, an effective corrosion inhibitor, as represented in Fig. 2, must be extremely economical, highly compatible with the aggressive medium, yield a desirable outcome when applied in small concentrations and also concur immensely with the environmental standards.

The commonly applied inhibitors are either inorganic or organic. Most of them have demonstrated decent results regarding solving corrosion problems for different metals in oil pipelines. But be that as it may, many of them are relatively costly, inaccessible, or ecologically detrimental (Abdel-Gaber et al., 2020; Khaleda et al., 2020; Lebrini et al., 2020; Neriyana & Alva, 2020; Xiang et al., 2021). Erstwhile, it was not uncommon for past researchers to study every other inhibition alternative except the natural polymers. Contemporary studies however have garnered their efforts toward exploring alternate sources that are non-toxic neither to the man nor to the environment. Thus far, attention has been directed toward employing eco-safe, cost-efficient, and natural inhibitors in the oil and gas industry (Zakaria et al., 2022). This review article, therefore, analyses the progress and future opportunities available for metal surface corrosion inhibition using natural plant polysaccharides. The review also highlights their respective inhibition modes and mechanisms, the environments and testing techniques, optimum polysaccharide concentrations, adsorption types, and their measured inhibition performance.


Polymeric Corrosion Inhibitors


A myriad of studies has proved the great performance of polymers when it comes to metal deterioration. They bear functional groups that form complexes with ions of metals, thus blanketing the metal surface from aggressive solutions (Arthur et al., 2013; Rizvi, 2021). Polymers also possess several possible attachment sites, have a lot of flexibility with derivation, and have a great potential to surpass the conventional macromolecule inhibitors (Tiu & Advincula, 2015). Polymeric corrosion inhibitors can either be natural or synthetic. The known hazardous effects of most synthetic polymeric corrosion inhibitors have motivated researchers to explore naturally occurring polymers as inhibitors (Biswas et al., 2017).


Biopolymers are a form of naturally occurring polymeric compounds generated by the cells of plants and animals. They are gaining apparent attention because they are environment-considerate and tolerable. Their sources are readily available in extensive amounts, and they bear several electron-rich sites that trigger their excellent anticorrosive activity (Verma & Quraishi, 2021). These adsorption sites enable them to bond with the metal surface and cover a wide area. The molecules are also large in size and have heteroatoms such as oxygen which donate electron lone pairs (Arthur et al., 2013; Palumbo et al., 2019; Shahini et al., 2021; Vaidya et al., 2021). Polysaccharides, natural rubber, nucleic acids, polypeptides, and lignin are some of the common biopolymers (Verma et al., 2021). Polysaccharides are further classified as starch, cellulose, chitin, dextrin, and chitosan as illustrated in Fig. 3 below. Some natural polymers have further been experimented with to produce graft copolymers, especially from plant gums such as gum Arabic, guar gum, xantham gum, etc (Vaidya et al., 2021).

Natural Plant Polysaccharides as Corrosion inhibitors


Plant extracts contain a blend of components such as proteins, polysaccharides, polycarboxylic acids, tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, and terepinoids which have proven to contribute to the high efficiency observed during corrosion inhibition (Dahmani et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2022; Ugi et al., 2018; Verma et al., 2018). Table 1 provides a summary of the recent applications of biopolymers and their derivatives for the inhibition of corrosion. The respective inhibition modes, mechanisms, corrosive media, testing techniques, optimum inhibitor concentrations, adsorption types, and their measured inhibition performance are also highlighted. It is summarily observed from Table 1 that the plant polysaccharides displayed high inhibition efficiencies, the majority over 85%, with adsorption behavior mostly involving both chemical and physical processes. (Umoren & Eduok, 2016) attributed their growing demand to this characteristic of simple chemistry.

Biopolymeric molecules have invaluable significance as potential substitutes for problematic corrosion inhibitors. However, future researchers have several considerations to give thought to. Before a natural polysaccharide is deemed efficient and safe, it is imperative to first run it through certain tests for example toxicity and bioaccumulation checks. Bioaccumulation is estimated by the partition coefficient method while toxicity is pre-investigated by mortality tests (Biswas et al., 2017). Longevity is another aspect that needs to be factored in while developing such inhibitors which are highly biodegradable and difficult to store up for a good length of time. The choice of extraction method and solvent used for extraction are other important factors. Seasonal availability and competition for sources of food with livestock and humans also pose a great threat to plant polysaccharides used for inhibition. Not to mention, the uncontrollable hydration rate, microbial contamination, and pH-dependent solubility and thermal stability (Arthur et al., 2013; Vaidya et al., 2021). Chemical modification with other polymers may be utilized to attempt to improve their performance using methods such as grafting, crosslinking, and nanocomposites (Banerjee et al., 2012; Mobin et al., 2017). Other researchers may also need to venture more into plant residue-extracted sources of polysaccharide materials, synergism with halide ions, and the addition of surfactants. These may all be considered to augment anticorrosion efficiencies so that the use of biopolymers is even more desirable (Arthur et al., 2013; Núñez-Morales et al., 2022; Roy et al., 2014; Vaidya et al., 2021).


Conclusion


A range of plants with high natural polysaccharide content has been reviewed and assessed for corrosion inhibition, in the light of the prevalent success of synthetic polymers. Previous studies have revealed that they are effective, biodegradable, renewable, and economical corrosion inhibitors. The efficiencies exhibited by these natural plant polysaccharides are usually over 90% with excellent surface cover on the metal surface. In their composition are the OH groups, heteroatoms, multiple adsorption centers, good film-forming capabilities, and surfactant nature which immensely enhances the formation of a protective barrier thereby reducing the likelihood of the corrosion reaction. It is recommended that the subsequent future investigations by contemporary researchers should have their focal point beyond the lab parameters revealed herein and focus more on commercializing and scaling up of the tested plant polysaccharides for mass industrial production. This will attract investment and make such research worthwhile.
