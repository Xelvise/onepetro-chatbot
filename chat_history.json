This process mimics the natural geological processes that transform biomass into fossil fuels over millions of years, but it accelerates the conversion significantly by using water as a solvent under high pressure and temperature conditions. The resulting bio-crude oil can be further upgraded into transportation fuels or other valuable products.\n\n**Check out related papers:**\n\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2118/212011-MS\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Gas Hydrate Formation and Dissociation Effect of Salinity of Formation Water in Subsea Flowline (Year: 2022)</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2118/211976-MS\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Dynamics of Heat Transport from a Reservoir to the Adjoining Formation in a Thermal Flood (Year: 2022)</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2118/211971-MS\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Experimental Study on Gas Reservoir Pore Pressure Changes During Natural Gas Recovery and CO2 Storage in Porous Medium (Year: 2022)</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2118/211988-MS\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Comparative Analysis of Gas Condensate Recovery by Carbon Dioxide Huff-N-Puff Carbon Dioxide Alternating Nitrogen and Nitrogen Injection A Simulation Study (Year: 2022)</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2118/212000-MS\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Hydrate Risk Management and Evaluation for Gas-Dominated Systems Using Machine Learning (Year: 2022)</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2118/211952-MS\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Modelling and Simulation of Liquid-Loaded Gas Flow (Year: 2022)</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2118/212008-MS\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Investigation of Gas-Lift Mitigation in Deepwater Pipeline-Riser System (Year: 2022)</a>\n\n"}]}
